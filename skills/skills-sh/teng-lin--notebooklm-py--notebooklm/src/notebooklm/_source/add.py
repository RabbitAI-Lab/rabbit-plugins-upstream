        """Add a Google Drive document as a source.

        Drive sources go through the same probe-then-create idempotency
        pattern as ``add_url``: a 5xx / network failure
        between server-side commit and client-side response could
        otherwise duplicate the source on a naive retry. The probe matches
        on :attr:`~notebooklm.types.Source.drive_document_id`, the Drive
        ``documentId`` the backend echoes back in the source metadata.
        Drive-backed sources carry **no** URL (their URL slots are empty),
        so a URL-based probe could never match one — it silently duplicated
        the source on every retry until #2113.

        A ``documentId`` is **not** unique within a notebook: the backend
        happily holds the same Drive file twice. The probe therefore filters
        matches against a baseline of source ids captured before the first
        create attempt, exactly like
        :meth:`~notebooklm._source.upload.SourceUploader.register_file_source`
        does for filenames, so a pre-existing copy is never handed back as if
        it were the one just created. This costs one extra source list per
        call; it is the price of telling "my create landed" apart from "a copy
        was already there".

        .. note::
           **This is a behaviour change.** ``add_drive`` now captures a baseline
           on *every* call; previously it listed sources only inside ``_probe``,
           which ``idempotent_create`` runs only after a transport failure. It
           now matches the shape ``register_file_source`` has always had (an
           unconditional pre-create baseline), so the cost is an extension of an
           existing pattern rather than a wholly new one — but for the Drive path
           it is new, moving from retry-only to every call.

           The concrete cost: that list is a ``GET_NOTEBOOK``, and the backend
           **writes** ``lastViewedTime`` when answering one (#2126), so every
           ``add_drive`` now promotes the notebook to the top of the user's
           *Recent* list in the web UI. No cheaper probe exists — source ids are
           published only inside the ``GET_NOTEBOOK`` payload, and
           ``LIST_NOTEBOOKS`` (which does not bump) does not carry them. The bump
           is accepted: silently returning a pre-existing source and reporting a
           create that never happened is far worse than a reordered Recent list.

           Sibling paths, so the next reader need not re-derive it: ``add_text``
           is ``NON_IDEMPOTENT_NO_RETRY`` and has no probe, so it has no such
           exposure. ``add_url`` *does* share the un-baselined shape this fix
           replaced — a notebook can hold two sources with the same URL — and is
           tracked separately in #2204; it is deliberately not changed here.

        .. warning::
           The baseline establishes *when* a matching source appeared, not
           *who* created it. If two callers add the same Drive file to one
           notebook concurrently and one create fails before committing, the
           failed caller's probe can attribute the other caller's source to
           itself. A list-based probe cannot close that gap — the wire carries
           no client-supplied idempotency key — so serialize concurrent adds of
           the same file into a notebook if you need that guarantee. The same
           limitation applies to ``register_file_source``'s filename probe.

        .. note::
           The ``title`` is sent on the wire but **ignored** for native Drive
           imports: NotebookLM re-derives the display title from live Drive
           metadata, so the returned source keeps the file's Drive name
           regardless of what you pass here. Call
           :meth:`~notebooklm._sources.SourcesAPI.rename` after the add if you
           need a specific title.
