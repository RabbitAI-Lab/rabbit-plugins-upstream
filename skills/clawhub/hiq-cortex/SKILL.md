# HiQ Cortex — LCA Data

Carbon footprint answers must come from real inventory data. A remembered "steel is about 2 kg CO₂e/kg" is useless to an LCA practitioner: the real value depends on database, version, system model, production route, and geography, and varies several-fold across those dimensions.

## About

This skill connects to **HiQ Cortex** — the LCA data service of [HiQ (海科数据)](https://www.hiqlcd.com/), a Chinese provider of LCA background data and carbon footprint services that maintains its own China-specific life-cycle inventory databases and aggregates major international sources.

Available:

- **18 life-cycle inventory databases**, 11 of them free. Includes China-specific data (HiQLCD covering China's full industrial system, HiQLCD-AL for the aluminium value chain, CALCD for the automotive sector) alongside international sources (Ecoinvent, BAFU, ELCD, EF, worldsteel, USLCI, AusLCI, CarbonMinds, Agri-footprint …).
- **24,000+ published EPDs** (EPDItaly, ECO Platform, EPD Norge) for peer distributions and outlier review.
- ISO 14040/14044 and GB/T 24040/24044 conventions; system models covering cut-off, consequential, APOS, and EN 15804.

**Search runs server-side.** Pass the user's own wording or raw BOM lines straight to the search endpoint — translating material names into LCA terminology, identifying production routes, and mapping categories to process direction all happen on the server. Returned candidates are already ranked and carry a match-quality marker. Do not re-derive search terms locally.

## Privacy and security

- The API key is **read only from the environment or the host's MCP config**. The skill never writes it to a file and never echoes it in output.
- Queries go **only to `x.hiqlcd.com`** (HiQ's API), never to any third party.
- **Nothing is collected or uploaded** — no local files, directory structure, or conversation content.
- The bundled script uses only the Python standard library, no third-party dependencies, and the source is auditable on [GitHub](https://github.com/HiQ-AI/agent-skills).

## Hard rules

1. **Every number must come from a tool call in this session.** Never state a GWP, LCIA value, or distribution from memory. If the tools are unavailable, say so — do not fill the gap.
2. **Every number needs its basis**: database + version + system model + geography + reference unit. `0.0269 kg CO₂e/kWh (BAFU 2025, DEFAULT, CH, low-voltage grid)` is usable; a bare `0.027` is not.
3. **Restricted is not an error.** Commercial databases return a restriction marker and a `purchase_url` when the account lacks the data package. Show it, hand the user the link, and **never silently substitute a value from another database or the literature**. Retrying does not help. A free database may be used instead, but say that it is a substitution.
4. **Do not compare across conventions.** Data with different functional units, system models, or system boundaries is not comparable — say so rather than presenting a misleading delta. Read `comparability_note` first; that is what it is for.

## Access

**With no credentials available, lead with browser sign-in — do not send the user to the console to create an API key.**

Sign-in is one command plus one click, with no registration. Creating an API key means logging into a console, finding the right page, copying a secret, and setting an environment variable — an order of magnitude more friction. Putting that first is how you lose the user.

```bash
python3 scripts/cortex.py login    # ← the default when no credential is present
```

The command prints an authorization link. **Hand the link to the user verbatim, have them click "authorize"**, then carry on with the original task. Credentials land in `~/.hiq/credentials.json` (mode 600) and every command works from then on; the visible data scope matches that account, **including any commercial databases it has access to**. `logout` removes them.

Only reach for an API key in three cases: the user asks for one, the environment is CI / server-side with no browser, or sign-in failed.

```bash
export HIQ_API_KEY=sk_xxx          # server-side / CI; takes precedence when both exist
```

The flow is three plain HTTP requests (standard device flow, RFC 8628) — any agent that can run a shell can do it without the script:

```bash
curl -sX POST https://x.hiqlcd.com/api/cortex/oauth/device_authorization \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"agent_id":"my-agent","agent_name":"My Assistant","scope":"lca_data"}'
# hand the returned verification_uri_complete to the user → they approve
curl -sX POST https://x.hiqlcd.com/api/cortex/oauth/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"device_code":"..."}'   # 428 = not yet approved, keep polling
```

Prefer MCP when the host supports it. If `lookup_datasets`, `aggregate_datasets`, `epd_search` are already available in this session, use them. Otherwise add this to the host's MCP config (WorkBuddy `~/.workbuddy/mcp.json`, Claude Code `~/.claude.json`, Cursor `~/.cursor/mcp.json`) and restart the host:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cortex": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://x.hiqlcd.com/api/cortex/mcp",
      "headers": { "X-API-Key": "sk_xxx" }
    }
  }
}
```

Credentials from `login` work too — replace that line with `"Authorization": "Bearer <credential>"`.

**Never hard-code credentials into files generated for the user.**

## Tools

| Need | MCP tool | Script command |
|---|---|---|
| Material / BOM line → dataset key | *(none, see below)* | `search "<user's wording>" [--sources X]` |
| Key → GWP, basis, links | `lookup_datasets` | `lookup <key> [<key> ...]` |
| Cohort → GWP distribution, percentile positioning | `aggregate_datasets` | `aggregate --source X [--target N]` |
| Cohort → non-GWP LCIA indicators (AP/EP/ODP/WDP/ADP) | `aggregate_indicators` | `indicators <keys> --indicator AP --source X` |
| Single dataset → process-level hotspots | `process_hotspot` | `hotspot <key>` |
| Published EPD search | `epd_search` | `epd "<query>" [--unit m3]` |
| EPD peer distribution, outlier check | `epd_peer_benchmark` | `epd-benchmark "<category>" --unit m3` |

Add `--json` to any script command for the raw payload.

Search has no MCP tool — it is a REST endpoint, wrapped by the script. Direct call:

```bash
curl -sN -X POST https://x.hiqlcd.com/api/cortex/search \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_xxx" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "query=304 stainless steel&sources=BAFU,Ecoinvent"
```

The response is SSE — parse the `WorkflowCompleted` event, then JSON-decode its `content` field. **It takes 20–40 seconds** (the server searches and verifies each hit). That is normal, not a hang; do not retry in parallel.

`dataset_key` is an opaque handle — pass it through unchanged, never construct or edit one.

## Reading the response

| Field | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `status: found` / `partial` / `not_found` | `partial` = results found, some restricted | Show them; handle restricted per hard rule 3 |
| `summary` | The server's account of this search | Relay it; do not invent a competing explanation |
| `fit: high / medium / low` | Server-assigned match quality | Confirm with the user before citing a `low` |
| `name` / `ref_product` / `location` | Dataset name, reference flow, geography | Read before citing — "cold-rolled annealed coil" and "heavy plate" are different products |
| `restricted: true` | No data package for that database | Give the `purchase_url`; a free-database alternative must be labelled as such |
| `missing_keys` non-empty | Key came from an older catalogue version | Search again; do not hand-edit keys |
| `comparability_note` | Cohort comparability caveats | Read before comparing |
| `entitlement` | An empty aggregate is an entitlement issue, not a predicate issue | Do not retry with a different predicate |

## Scenario routing

Top to bottom, first match wins.

| Signal | What to do |
|---|---|
| User gives **their own** number and asks where it sits ("is my 2.5 high or low") | `aggregate` with a cohort predicate + `--target` → percentile positioning |
| A material or BOM to match against datasets | `search` → batch `lookup` |
| Comparing two production routes (BF-BOF vs EAF steel, primary vs recycled aluminium) | Search and aggregate each route separately, compare under one functional unit |
| "Is this EPD value reasonable" | `epd-benchmark` with an explicit `--unit`; cross-unit comparison is meaningless |
| Multi-indicator assessment (acidification, eutrophication …) | `indicators`, one indicator at a time; `--source` must match the cohort's database |

## When to ask the user

**Search first, compare second, ask last.** If there is anything searchable — a material name, product, process, or BOM line — search it and give results in the same turn. Do not ask for information already stated in the conversation.

"I'm not sure which one to use" is a **decision-support signal, not a question**: give the candidate list, compare under one convention, explain which dimension drives the difference, and give a conditional recommendation where the evidence supports one. A complete advisory answer can end there.

Only ask when a single dataset must be finalised and the remaining ambiguity would materially change the result. Options must correspond to **candidates already shown** — never invent them. Use the host's interaction facility if one exists, and do not duplicate the options as a text list. After the answer, complete the match on the existing results; do not re-run the same search.

## Data entitlements

| Tier | Content | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Catalogue | All 18 databases: inventory, versions, system models, LCIA coverage; dataset names, units, geographies | None |
| Free database values | GWP and aggregates for BAFU, USLCI, ELCD, EF, AusLCI, NEEDS, ozLCI, worldsteel, USDA, bioenergiedat, recycledplastics | Any valid credential |
| Commercial database values | GWP and aggregates for Ecoinvent, HiQLCD, HiQLCD-AL, CALCD (automotive), CarbonMinds, Agri-footprint | Matching data package |

Data packages and subscription plans are **two separate systems** — upgrading a plan does not unlock a database. When something is restricted, name the database, hand over the `purchase_url`, and offer a free-database path if one answers the same question, labelled as a substitution.

## Voice and terminology

Write for LCA practitioners, like a knowledgeable peer.

- No pleasantries ("I hope this helps", "let me help you"), no adjective stacking, no summarising sign-off.
- Use ISO 14040/14044, ILCD, and GB/T 24040 terminology — for this audience, standard terms are **clearer** than plain language.
- unit process · elementary flow · reference flow · functional unit · system boundary · impact category · characterisation factor · cut-off · consequential.
- Do not invent terminology. When unsure of the standard term, use the ISO wording.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `401 {"code":"INT-007"}` | Used Bearer, or the key is invalid | Use `X-API-Key` |
| CDN returns `error 1010` | Default HTTP client User-Agent is blocked | The bundled script sets one; add a normal `User-Agent` on direct calls |
| Search takes 30 seconds | Normal — it searches and verifies | Wait; do not retry in parallel |
| Aggregate `status: "empty"` **with** `entitlement` | Commercial database, no package | Not a predicate problem; do not retry |
| Aggregate `status: "empty"` **without** `entitlement` | The predicate genuinely matched nothing | Broaden the predicate |
| `indicators` returns empty | `source` must equal the cohort's actual database (`method_id` is not portable) | Pass the correct `--source` |
| Cohort values span orders of magnitude | Mixed functional units, not real dispersion | Narrow the predicate; read `comparability_note` first |
| Authorization polling returns `428` | The user has not approved yet | Normal — keep polling at the returned `interval` |
| Still no commercial data after login | That account has no such data package | Login only changes credentials, not entitlements; show the purchase link |
