# HiQ Cortex — LCA Data

Carbon-footprint answers must come from real inventory data. A remembered "steel ≈ 2 kg CO₂e/kg" is not usable by an LCA practitioner: the real value depends on database, version, system model, production route, and geography, and it swings by multiples across them.

## About

This skill connects to **HiQ Cortex** — the LCA data service of [HiQ Data](https://www.hiqlcd.com/). HiQ Data is a Chinese provider of LCA background data and carbon-footprint services, maintaining its own China-specific life-cycle inventory database alongside aggregated international sources.

Through this skill you can reach:

- **18 life-cycle inventory databases**, 11 of them free. Includes **China-specific data** (HiQLCD covering China's full industrial system, CALCD, HiQ-CESI for electronics and appliances, HiQLCD-AL for the aluminium value chain) and the major international sources (Ecoinvent, BAFU, ELCD, EF, worldsteel, USLCI, AusLCI, CarbonMinds, Agri-footprint …). Use China-specific databases for Chinese production — do not substitute European data.
- **24,000+ published EPDs** (EPDItaly, ECO Platform, EPD Norge) for peer distributions and outlier review.
- Alignment with ISO 14040/14044 and GB/T 24040/24044, with system models covering cut-off, consequential, APOS, and EN 15804.

Applicable to product carbon footprints, BOM carbon accounting, CBAM filing, EPD authoring and review, eco-design selection, and industry benchmarking.

## Privacy & Security

- The API key is read **only from the environment or the host's MCP config**. The skill never writes it to a file and never echoes it in output.
- Queries go **to `x.hiqlcd.com` only** (the HiQ Data API) and to no third party.
- **Nothing else is collected or uploaded** — no local files, directory structures, or conversation content.
- The bundled script uses the Python standard library only, with no third-party dependencies. The source is auditable: [GitHub](https://github.com/HiQ-AI/agent-skills).

## Ground rules

1. **Every number comes from a tool call in this session.** Never state a GWP, LCIA value, or distribution from memory. If the tool is unreachable, say so — do not fill the gap from memory.
2. **State the basis with every number**: database + version + system model + geography + reference unit. `0.0269 kg CO₂e/kWh (BAFU 2025, DEFAULT, CH, low-voltage grid)` is usable; a bare `0.027` is not.
3. **Restricted ≠ error.** Commercial databases return a restriction flag and a `purchase_url` when the account lacks that data package. Show it truthfully, give the user the link, and **never silently substitute a value from another database or from literature**. Retrying will not help. You may switch to a free database, but must label it as a substitute.
4. **Never compare across incompatible bases.** Different functional units, system models (cut-off / consequential / APOS / EN 15804), or system boundaries are not comparable — say so instead of producing a misleading delta.

## Setup

Two ways to reach the data. **Check which one is available before answering**, and offer to set up the other when it would serve the user better.

### Option A — MCP server (preferred when the host supports it)

If tools named `lookup_datasets`, `aggregate_datasets`, `epd_search` are already available in this session, use them directly and skip to [Tools](#tools).

If not, offer to configure it — write this into the host's MCP config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cortex": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://x.hiqlcd.com/api/cortex/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "sk_xxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Host | Config file |
|---|---|
| WorkBuddy | `~/.workbuddy/mcp.json` (user) or `<project>/.workbuddy/mcp.json` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude.json` or `<project>/.mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or `<project>/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Cline / others | the host's MCP settings file |

You can also use a credential obtained by browser sign-in (see below) — swap that line for `"Authorization": "Bearer <credential>"`. The gateway detects the credential type automatically; supply one of the two, never both.

The host usually needs a restart to pick up a new server.

### Option B — bundled script (works anywhere, zero config)

Use this when the host has no MCP support, or the user would rather not edit config files. Standard library only, no `pip install`:

```bash
python3 scripts/cortex.py login          # one click in the browser, no API key needed
python3 scripts/cortex.py search "304 stainless steel"
```

### Two ways to get a credential

**Browser sign-in (lowest friction)**

```bash
python3 scripts/cortex.py login
```

Opens an approval page; the user clicks "authorize" (a single click if already signed in to Cortex). The credential is stored at `~/.hiq/credentials.json` with mode 600, and every later command just works. Visible data matches that user's own account — **including any commercial databases they have licensed** — with nothing extra to configure.

`python3 scripts/cortex.py logout` removes the local credential. It expires with the user's session; to revoke immediately, sign out on the web.

You can run the same flow yourself without the script — it is three plain HTTP calls, so any agent that can run shell commands can do it:

```bash
# 1) start; returns verification_uri_complete + device_code
curl -sX POST https://lab.hiq.earth/deck/oauth/device_authorization \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"agent_id":"my-agent","agent_name":"My Agent","scope":"lca_data"}'

# 2) user opens verification_uri_complete and approves

# 3) poll until it returns access_token (428 = still pending)
curl -sX POST https://lab.hiq.earth/deck/oauth/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"device_code":"..."}'
```

**API key (for server-side integrations / CI)**

Register at [hiqlcd.com](https://www.hiqlcd.com/), create an API key in the account console, then:

```bash
export HIQ_API_KEY=sk_xxx
```

The environment variable takes precedence over a stored sign-in credential. Rate limit: 100 requests/minute.

**Never hardcode a credential into files you generate for the user** — environment variable, the host's config file, or the file `login` writes.

## Tools

| Need | MCP tool | Script command |
|---|---|---|
| Material name → dataset key | *(none, see below)* | `search "<terms>" [--sources X]` |
| Key → GWP, basis, link | `lookup_datasets` | `lookup <key> [<key> ...]` |
| Cohort → GWP distribution, percentile position | `aggregate_datasets` | `aggregate --source X [--target N]` |
| Cohort → non-GWP LCIA indicators (AP/EP/ODP/WDP/ADP) | `aggregate_indicators` | `indicators <keys> --indicator AP --source X` |
| Single dataset → process-level hotspots | `process_hotspot` | `hotspot <key>` |
| Published EPD search | `epd_search` | `epd "<terms>" [--unit m3]` |
| EPD peer distribution, outlier check | `epd_peer_benchmark` | `epd-benchmark "<category>" --unit m3` |

Add `--json` to any script command for the raw payload.

**Search has no MCP tool** — dataset keys come from a REST endpoint that the script wraps. To call it directly:

```bash
curl -sN -X POST https://x.hiqlcd.com/api/cortex/search \
  -H "X-API-Key: sk_xxx" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "query=304 stainless steel&sources=BAFU,Ecoinvent"
```

The response is SSE — parse the `WorkflowCompleted` event, then JSON-decode its `content` field. It **takes 20–40 seconds** (it searches and validates); that is normal, not a hang. Do not retry in parallel.

Keys are opaque handles. Pass them through verbatim; never construct or edit them.

**Some server-side notes come back in Chinese.** `comparability_note`, aggregation `note`, and search summaries are currently emitted in Chinese by the backend. Read them — they carry real constraints (mixed units, small sample size, missing entitlement) — and **paraphrase them in the user's language**. Never paste the raw Chinese string into an English answer, and never drop the constraint because of the language.

## Core workflow

1. **Search** for the material, product, or process → candidate keys. For route-sensitive materials (aluminium, steel, hydrogen, plastics), consult [references/materials.md](references/materials.md) first to decide which variants to search and whether clarification is needed.
2. **Read the candidate names before using them.** LCA datasets are specific: "cold-rolled annealed coil, 304 stainless" and "heavy plate, 304 stainless" are different products with different footprints. Search status `partial` means related but inexact — verify before citing.
3. **Batch the lookup** when you need values: pass all keys in one call.
4. **State the basis.** When candidates differ materially, show 2–3 and explain what drives the difference.
5. **Recommend one** only when the request supports it, and state the assumptions behind it.

## When to ask the user

LCA queries are inherently ambiguous: a single "304 stainless steel" matches a dozen datasets differing in product form, production route, geography, and system model. Handle ambiguity in this order — **search first, compare second, ask last** — not by asking upfront, and not by dumping candidates on the user.

**Do not ask when**

- The answer is already inferable from the request or conversation history. If the user said "our plant in Jiangsu", do not ask about geography.
- You have not searched yet. As soon as there is something searchable (material name, product, process, BOM line), search and deliver results in the same turn.
- The question is a generic filler in place of a real decision ("Is there anything else you'd like?").

**Compare first, don't ask**

When the user signals uncertainty ("primary or recycled aluminium", "BF-BOF or EAF", "which one should I use"), that is not a prompt to ask — it is a request for **decision support**. Instead:

1. Present the tool-backed candidates;
2. Compare them side by side under the same functional unit and system model;
3. Explain what drives the difference (energy mix, scrap share, allocation method, boundary) and under what conditions the conclusion flips;
4. Give a conditional recommendation where the evidence supports one ("for a Chinese grid with 30% recycled content, choose X").

A complete advisory answer can end there, with no follow-up question.

**Do ask when**

Only when the user must settle on **one** dataset and the remaining ambiguity would materially change the result. In that case:

- Options must correspond to **candidates you already showed** — do not invent options;
- Spell out what each option means (which route, which geography, which basis);
- Use the host's interaction capability (tool names differ per host — use `AskUserQuestion` / `AskQuestion` if available; otherwise just ask clearly in the reply);
- Do not present interactive options and a duplicate written list of the same options.

Once the user answers, complete the match against results you already have — do not re-run the same search.

## Scenario routing

Route first, top to bottom, first match wins. Routing wrong wastes the whole turn — if the user asks "is mine high or low" and you return a single lookup, you answered a different question.

| Signal | Action |
|---|---|
| User gives **their own** number and asks where it sits ("is my 2.5 high or low", "how do we compare to peers") | `aggregate` with a cohort predicate + `--target` → percentile positioning. Method and comparability gates in [references/scenarios.md](references/scenarios.md) |
| No BOM yet, wants an order of magnitude or an A/B comparison ("roughly what scale") | Decompose by composition + combine p25–p75 ranges per material → give a **range**, never a falsely precise point value. See [references/scenarios.md](references/scenarios.md) |
| Route-sensitive material (BF-BOF vs EAF steel, primary vs recycled aluminium, grey vs green hydrogen) | Search and aggregate each route separately, compare under one functional unit — see [references/comparability.md](references/comparability.md) |
| A material or BOM to match against datasets | Search → batch lookup. Material families, route distinctions, and product decomposition in [references/materials.md](references/materials.md) |
| "Is this EPD value reasonable?" | `epd-benchmark` with an explicit `--unit`; cross-unit comparison is meaningless |
| Multi-indicator assessment (acidification, eutrophication …) | `indicators`, one indicator at a time; `--source` must match the cohort's database |

## Data entitlements

| Tier | Content | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Catalogue | Listing, versions, system models, and LCIA coverage of all 18 databases; dataset names, units, geographies | No entitlement |
| Free-database values | GWP and aggregate statistics for BAFU, USLCI, ELCD, EF, AusLCI, NEEDS, ozLCI, worldsteel, USDA, bioenergiedat, recycledplastics | Any valid key |
| Commercial-database values | GWP and aggregate statistics for Ecoinvent, HiQLCD, HiQLCD-AL, CarbonMinds, Agri-footprint, CALCD, HiQ-CESI | Corresponding data-package entitlement |

Without entitlement, `lookup` returns `restricted: true` and aggregation returns `status: "empty"` with an `entitlement` field; both carry a `purchase_url`. Tell the user which database is restricted and give them the link; if a free database can answer the same question, offer that path. Data-package entitlements and subscription plans are **two independent systems** — upgrading a plan does not unlock databases.

The free databases cover a lot of ground: BAFU (Switzerland, complete LCIA, the best free default in a European context), USLCI (US unit processes), ELCD / EF (European reference), worldsteel (global steel), USDA (agriculture).

## Tone and terminology

You are writing for LCA practitioners. Write like a knowledgeable peer.

- No pleasantries ("I hope this helps", "let me help you with that"), no adjective stacking, no summarising sign-off.
- Use the standard vocabulary of ISO 14040/14044, ILCD, and GB/T 24040 — for this audience, standard terms are **clearer** than plain language, not less clear.
- unit process · elementary flow · intermediate flow · reference flow · functional unit · system boundary · impact category · category indicator · characterization factor · cut-off · consequential.
- Do not invent terminology. When unsure of the standard name, use the ISO/GB wording verbatim.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `401 {"code":"INT-007"}` | Bearer used, or invalid key | Switch to `X-API-Key` |
| CDN returns `error 1010` | Default HTTP-client User-Agent is blocked | The bundled script sets one; when calling directly, send a normal `User-Agent` |
| Search takes 30 seconds | Normal — it searches and validates | Wait; do not retry in parallel |
| `missing_keys` non-empty | Keys came from an older catalogue version | Search again for current keys |
| `restricted: true` | No data-package entitlement | Give the `purchase_url`; a free-database alternative is fine; **never silently substitute the value** |
| Aggregate `status: "empty"` **with** `entitlement` | Commercial database, no entitlement | As above — this is **not** a predicate problem; do not retry with a different predicate |
| Aggregate `status: "empty"` **without** `entitlement` | The predicate genuinely matched nothing | Loosen the predicate |
| `indicators` returns empty | `source` must equal the cohort's actual database (`method_id` is not portable across databases) | Pass the correct `--source` |
| Cohort values span several orders of magnitude | Mixed functional units, not real dispersion | Narrow the predicate; read `comparability_note` first |
| Polling returns `428` | The user has not approved yet | Normal — keep polling at the returned `interval`; do not treat it as a failure |
| Still restricted after signing in | That account genuinely lacks the data package | Signing in swaps the credential, it does not grant entitlements — surface the purchase link |
