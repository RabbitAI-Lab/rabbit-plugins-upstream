  GitHub trend intelligence for AI agents — a daily scan of trending new GitHub repos, LLM-analyzed
  into a structured digest (top categories, language trends, emerging tools, notable projects,
  overall sentiment), plus the raw enriched trending-repo rows behind it (stars, forks, language,
  topics, license, author, README excerpt). Pay-per-call via x402 (USDC on Base only); no accounts,
  no API keys. Free /v1/index, /v1/brief, /v1/sample, and /v1/digests/latest expose every response
  shape before you pay.

# gitBeacon — GitHub Trend Intelligence for AI Agents

API at `https://api.gitbeacon.dev` (website `https://gitbeacon.dev`). gitBeacon watches new repositories that trend on GitHub each day, enriches each candidate (stars, forks, language, topics, license, author followers, README excerpt), and has an LLM synthesize the day into a structured digest — dominant categories of work, emerging tools and frameworks, language-popularity trends, the most notable projects, and an overall sentiment. Strictly pay-per-call via x402 — no accounts, no API keys, no bundles. Compute-first / settle-after: you are **never** charged for an error.

> gitBeacon is the GitHub-trends intelligence product spun out of moltalyzer. The old paths `/api/github/*` on `api.moltalyzer.xyz` **308-redirect** here until **2026-09-08** — point new integrations at `api.gitbeacon.dev`.

## Free endpoints (no auth, no payment)

Poll for free to detect new digests and learn every response shape before paying. `/v1/sample` is a **FROZEN** sample digest (captured from the 2026-02-13 scan) — the same shape as a real digest, but it never changes and is labelled as such, so it is safe for testing without implying live data.

| Method | Path | Rate limit | Description |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| GET | `/v1/index` | 10/min | Poll target — current digest id, `digestDate`, `updatedAt` + `nextExpected` (24h cadence), so agents detect new digests without paying |
| GET | `/v1/brief` | 10/min | Field-trimmed snapshot of the current daily digest — title, summary, top categories, language trends, overall sentiment, `digestDate` |
| GET | `/v1/sample` | 5/min | FROZEN sample digest (2026-02-13 scan) — same shape as a real digest, never changes. Learn the response contract before paying |
| GET | `/v1/digests/latest` | 5/min | Most recent completed daily digest, full fields: `fullAnalysis`, `notableProjects`, `emergingTools`, language trends, volume metrics |

```bash
curl https://api.gitbeacon.dev/v1/digests/latest
```

## Paid endpoints (x402 V2, USDC on Base only, per-call)

Each paid call is a flat price per call, settled per call via x402. Networks: **Base Mainnet only** (`eip155:8453`). Compute-first / settle-after — you are never charged for an error.

| Method | Path | Price | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| GET | `/v1/repos?limit=30&language=Python` | **$0.01** | Top trending GitHub repos from the latest daily scan, sorted by stars — description, language, topics, license, forks, author followers, README excerpt. Response carries `scanDate` provenance |
| GET | `/v1/digests?days=7&limit=7` | **$0.05** | Historical daily digests (1-30 day lookback) — track how open-source trends, language popularity, and emerging tools evolve over time; each digest carries the same rich analysis as `/v1/digests/latest`, keyed by `digestDate` provenance |

Params for `/v1/repos`: `limit` (integer 1-100, default 30), `language` (case-insensitive language filter, e.g. `Python`, `Rust`, `TypeScript`). Params for `/v1/digests`: `days` (integer 1-30, default 7), `limit` (integer 1-30, default 7). All prices are USD, settled as USDC (6 decimals) on Base.

## Paying (x402)

Paid routes settle per call via **x402 V2**. The only accepted rail is **USDC on Base Mainnet** (`eip155:8453`) — no other network. No account, no signup, no API key.

Pay flow:
1. Call the paid route with no payment → receive **HTTP 402**. The x402 V2 `PaymentRequirements` ride in the base64 `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header; the JSON body mirrors the price + `accepts`.
2. Sign an **EIP-3009 `exact`** USDC authorization on Base for the `accepts[]` amount.
3. Retry the same request with the payment in the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` (V2) or `X-PAYMENT` (legacy) header.

```bash
# 1. Probe for the 402 challenge (price + accepts):
curl -i "https://api.gitbeacon.dev/v1/repos?limit=30&language=Python"
# → HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required, PAYMENT-REQUIRED header (base64 requirements)

# 2. Sign + retry with a stock x402 client (handles the whole flow):
```

```typescript
import { wrapFetchWithPayment } from "@x402/fetch";
import { createWalletClient, http } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { base } from "viem/chains";

const account = privateKeyToAccount(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`);
const wallet = createWalletClient({ account, chain: base, transport: http() });
const fetchWithPay = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, wallet); // signs EIP-3009 on 402, retries

// $0.01 — top trending repos, filtered to Rust:
const repos = await fetchWithPay(
  "https://api.gitbeacon.dev/v1/repos?limit=30&language=Rust",
).then((r) => r.json());
// repos.scanDate, repos.count, repos.data[] (fullName, stars, language, topics, readmeExcerpt, …)

// $0.05 — historical digests, last 7 days:
const digests = await fetchWithPay(
  "https://api.gitbeacon.dev/v1/digests?days=7&limit=7",
).then((r) => r.json());
```

Stock x402 clients (`@x402/fetch`, `@x402/axios`, python `x402`) do the 402 → sign → retry automatically. Discover the machine-readable route + price catalog at `/.well-known/x402`.

## Free funnel

Try every response shape for free before you pay. Poll `/v1/index` (10/min) to detect a new digest on its ~24h cadence; read `/v1/brief` (10/min) for the trimmed current digest or `/v1/digests/latest` (5/min) for the full latest digest; hit `/v1/sample` (5/min) for the frozen 2026-02-13 digest to learn the exact response contract before spending. The paid `/v1/repos` and `/v1/digests` carry `scanDate`/`digestDate` provenance so you always know how fresh the data is.
