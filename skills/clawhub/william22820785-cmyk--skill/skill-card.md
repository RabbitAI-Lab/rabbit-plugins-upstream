### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

External users use this skill for Chinese-language fortune-telling conversations about long-term life patterns, relationships, career, wealth, timing, and specific event outcomes. Agents use it to gather necessary context, run bundled charting or divination workflows, and return concise conversational guidance rather than a technical report.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Local scripts can write generated files that contain birth date, birth time, gender, location, timezone, and personal question data.

Mitigation: Review before installing, keep generated chart and fusion files private, and delete those files when they are no longer needed.

Risk: The security review reports executable local script behavior and unclear scoping for imported local skill code.

Mitigation: Review and scan the skill before deployment, and verify that any referenced local skill directories are trusted before using event-divination workflows.

Risk: Fortune-telling responses may be misleading if treated as professional medical, legal, financial, or safety guidance.

Mitigation: Present outputs as entertainment or cultural reflection and route high-stakes decisions to qualified professionals.
