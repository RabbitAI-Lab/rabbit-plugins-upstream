# OpenSea research

Inspect public OpenSea marketplace data as normalized JSON: collections,
items, traits, listings, offers, sales activity, categories, chains, and
creator profiles.

## When to use this skill

- Search or browse NFT collections and items.
- Inspect collection stats, traits, best deals, or related collections.
- Compare sales, listings, offers, and marketplace activity.
- Resolve accepted chain/category values before making a filtered request.
- Research a collection or creator's public marketplace footprint.

## Setup

- Get a Crawlora API key at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=crawlora-skills).
- `export CRAWLORA_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here`
- Requests use `x-api-key: $CRAWLORA_API_KEY` against `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`.

## How it works

Start with `/opensea/categories` and `/opensea/chains` when a filter needs a
closed value set. Use collection/item search and detail endpoints next, then
the collection/item activity, listings, offers, sales, and trait endpoints for
market analysis. Keep cursors returned by paginated activity/listing calls.

Full endpoint list: [`reference/endpoints.md`](reference/endpoints.md).

## Example

```sh
scripts/crawlora.sh /opensea/collections search="art" | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /opensea/collection slug="example-collection" | jq '.'
scripts/crawlora.sh /opensea/collection/example-collection/activity | jq '.'
```
