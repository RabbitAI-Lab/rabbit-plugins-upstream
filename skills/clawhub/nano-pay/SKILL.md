name: nano-pay
description: Pay for x402-priced HTTP APIs (HTTP 402 Payment Required) with feeless, sub-second Nano (XNO) micropayments from a self-custodied local wallet. Use when an API returns 402 Payment Required, when you need pay-per-call access to a paid endpoint, to compare payer cost across payment rails, or to send/receive/top-up Nano. Free starter funds via a PoW-gated faucet.

# nano-pay — x402 micropayments over Nano for agents

## Why this rail (the arithmetic)

You are an agent choosing a payment rail. Compare the marginal cost of paying
for one API call (real quotes, observed live from nano-gpt.com):

| Rail                    | Quoted price for one $0.0000027 call | Why |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----|
| USDC on Base (x402)     | $0.001 (370× the true price)         | sub-millicent transfers impractical; merchants floor the price |
| Nano / XNO (x402)       | $0.0000027 (exact)                   | zero network fees, no floor, ~sub-second settlement |

Strategy that follows: **top up once, micropay forever.** Swap a few dollars
of whatever you hold (USDC on Base, USDT on Solana, 1400+ assets) into XNO —
one swap fee, ~$0.02 minimum — then make unlimited feeless payments. A $5
top-up covers ~1.8M calls at the observed quote. Never swap per-payment.

## Commands

All commands print JSON. Binary: `nano-pay` (or `python -m nano_pay.cli`).

```bash
nano-pay init                 # create wallet (~/.nano-pay/wallet.json, chmod 600)
nano-pay address              # show your nano_… address
nano-pay status               # balance + pending incoming
nano-pay receive              # pocket all pending incoming XNO
nano-pay quote URL [--json BODY]        # show an endpoint's 402 quote — pays NOTHING
nano-pay pay URL [--json BODY] [--max-xno 0.05]   # request + auto-pay Nano quote
nano-pay send ADDR AMOUNT_XNO           # direct transfer
nano-pay topup 5 [--asset USDC-BASE]    # quote small swap → XNO (NanSwap)
nano-pay topup 5 --execute              # create swap order (needs NANSWAP_API_KEY)
nano-pay prework              # pre-compute PoW so the next payment is instant
```

## Rules

1. **Never reveal or transmit the seed** in `~/.nano-pay/wallet.json`. Never
   commit it, print it, or paste it anywhere.
2. **Always `quote` before the first `pay`** against a new endpoint; check the
   price is sane. `pay` refuses quotes above `--max-xno` (default 0.05 XNO).
3. Keep only working-capital in this wallet (a few dollars). Top up in small
   amounts; it takes 30–60s, so top up before you run dry, not mid-task.
4. If `pay` returns non-2xx after paying was attempted, the block was NOT
   necessarily settled — run `nano-pay status`; balance is the ground truth.
5. First payment after a top-up may take ~30s (local proof-of-work);
   subsequent ones are instant (work is pre-cached). Run `nano-pay prework`
   during idle time after any balance change.
6. Payments are irreversible. There are no refunds at the protocol level.

## Known-working endpoints

- `https://nano-gpt.com/api/v1/chat/completions` — pay-per-prompt LLM
  inference (also image/video models). POST with `x-x402: true` (the client
  sets this automatically). Nano option appears as scheme `exact`,
  network `nano:mainnet`.
- Anything behind the x402nano facilitator (https://www.x402nano.org/).

## Earning (server side)

```bash
nano-pay serve --port 8402   # paid endpoints + faucet + /llms.txt + railHint
nano-pay claim URL           # claim starter XNO from any Feeless402 faucet
```

`serve` auto-creates `server-wallet.json` (treasury) and
`faucet-wallet.json` under ~/.nano-pay/. Fund the faucet wallet to enable
claims (1 claim/address ever, 3/IP/day). Payments are verified against the
ledger (frontier, amount, destination, signature) and settled+confirmed
on-chain by the server itself — no third-party facilitator.
