### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Users and analysts query videos associated with a Douyin hashtag to identify popular posts or review results in pages.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Video lookups may incur Qinghu credits, with higher charges for larger results.

Mitigation: Check the current estimate, explain expected charges, and obtain consent before paid calls or large batches.

Risk: The skill asks agents to install or upgrade Node and the qhkit package on the user's system.

Mitigation: Prefer a preinstalled, reviewed qhkit version and confirm any package installation or upgrade explicitly.

Risk: Using the service requires a Qinghu API token.

Mitigation: Provide only the token needed for this service and avoid exposing it in shared outputs.
