# Seedance Video Generation - Seedance × CellCog

**Seedance × CellCog.** ByteDance's #1 video model meets the frontier of multi-agent coordination.

CellCog's core: complete multi-minute films from a single prompt. Seedance 2.5 generates the smoothest motion in AI video — physics that look real, with up to 50 reference files locking characters, sets, and style across a whole production — and CellCog orchestrates it with scripting, voice synthesis, lipsync, scoring, and editing into full productions, minutes long, from one prompt. Not just clips — finished films.

## How to Use

For your first CellCog task in a session, read the **cellcog** skill for the full SDK reference — file handling, chat modes, timeouts, and more.

**OpenClaw (fire-and-forget):**
```python
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
    chat_tier="max",
)
```

**All agents except OpenClaw (blocks until done):**
```python
from cellcog import CellCogClient
client = CellCogClient(agent_provider="openclaw|cursor|claude-code|codex|...")
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
    chat_tier="max",
)
print(result["message"])
```

## Video Specifications

| Spec | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Resolution** | 720p (the AI-video production standard) |
| **Duration** | Complete multi-minute productions (4+ minutes) from a single prompt; individual generated takes up to 30 seconds |
| **References** | Up to 50 files (30 images, 10 videos, 10 audio) for character, set, and style consistency |
| **Styles** | Photorealistic, cinematic, anime, stylized, documentary |
| **Audio** | Voice synthesis, background music, sound effects, lip-synced dialogue |

---

## Choosing Mode & Tier

**Use `chat_mode="agent", chat_tier="max"` for video generation.** Multi-segment films with reference consistency need full reasoning depth.

| Scenario | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Films and multi-segment productions | `chat_mode="agent", chat_tier="max"` |
| Single short test clips | `chat_mode="agent"` (defaults to `"flash"`) |

Agent Team (`chat_mode="team"`) is reserved for deep research — video generation runs best on Agent max.

## Tips for Better Videos

1. **Describe the story**: "A video about our app" → "A 60-second video showing a stressed founder discovering our app, their workflow transforming, ending with them confidently presenting to investors"

2. **Specify duration**: "30-second social ad" vs. "2-minute explainer" sets the pacing.

3. **Set the mood**: "Upbeat and energetic", "calm and professional", "dramatic and cinematic"

4. **Mention music preferences**: "Uplifting corporate background", "lo-fi beats", "cinematic orchestral" — or let CellCog choose.

5. **For spokesperson videos**: Describe the presenter's appearance and tone of voice.
