# Gingiris Growth Finder

**The meta-skill that picks the right Gingiris playbook for your growth problem.**

Growth questions look similar but require wildly different playbooks. "How do I launch?" for a dev tool is nothing like "How do I launch?" for a mobile app. "How do I grow?" at $1M ARR is nothing like "How do I grow?" at 100 DAU. This skill diagnoses the situation and invokes the specialist.

---

## How to use

Just ask your growth question naturally. Example prompts:

- "I'm launching my AI SaaS next week — what should I prioritize?"
- "My open source project has 2k stars, how do I get to 10k?"
- "I have a B2B SaaS at $300k ARR, should I hire SDRs?"
- "My iOS app isn't ranking for its main keyword, what do I do?"

The skill will diagnose three dimensions, then invoke the matching playbook:

1. **Product type** — SaaS / open source / mobile app / consumer web / marketplace / dev tool
2. **Growth stage** — pre-launch / launch / post-launch cold start / growth / scale
3. **Primary channel gap** — content / community / paid / partnerships / product-led

---

## Diagnostic routing logic

| If the user's question is about... | Route to |
|---|---|
| Product Hunt launch, hunter outreach, launch-day tactics, viral moment engineering | **gingiris-launch** |
| GitHub stars, HackerNews, OSS marketing, developer community, awesome-lists, Show HN | **gingiris-opensource** |
| B2B SaaS, PLG vs SLG, PMF validation, freemium, enterprise motion, affiliate, channel partnerships | **gingiris-b2b-growth** |
| ASO, App Store / Google Play, mobile user acquisition, TikTok/Reels/Shorts UGC, creator matrix | **gingiris-aso-growth** |

If the question spans multiple domains (e.g. "I have an open source project that I want to monetize as B2B SaaS"), route to **both** relevant skills and explain the handoff.

---

## Decision framework (for the agent)

When the user asks a growth question, run this quick triage **before** invoking a specialist skill:

### Step 1 — Classify the product

Ask or infer:
- What is it? (SaaS web app / mobile app / OSS project / marketplace / browser extension)
- Who's the ICP? (individual developer / SMB / enterprise / consumer)
- Distribution default? (self-serve web signup / app store / GitHub / sales-led)

### Step 2 — Identify the stage

- **Pre-launch** — building, no users yet
- **Launch** — within 30 days of public release
- **Cold start** — launched but <100 WAU/DAU, <1k signups
- **Growth** — steady signal, scaling what works
- **Scale** — $1M+ ARR or 10k+ DAU, needs systems

### Step 3 — Spot the gap

Listen for the *actual* bottleneck, not the stated question:

- "I'm not getting signups" → distribution channel gap
- "I'm getting signups but no conversions" → product/pricing gap (not growth — redirect)
- "I have users but no growth loop" → retention/virality gap
- "I have a growth loop but can't scale ads" → monetization gap

### Step 4 — Route

Invoke the specialist skill. Examples:

```
User: "I have a dev tool CLI with 500 GitHub stars. How do I get to 5k?"
→ Diagnosis: OSS project, growth stage, distribution gap
→ Invoke: gingiris-opensource
→ Context hint: focus on GitHub trending + HN relaunch + awesome-lists

User: "My iOS photo app has 80 DAU after 2 months. What's wrong?"
→ Diagnosis: mobile app, cold-start stage, distribution+UGC gap
→ Invoke: gingiris-aso-growth
→ Context hint: focus on ASO audit first, then TikTok creator matrix

User: "I'm launching an AI coding assistant on Product Hunt in 3 weeks."
→ Diagnosis: dev tool, pre-launch, launch-day engineering needed
→ Invoke: gingiris-launch
→ Context hint: 3-week timeline → hunter network + pre-launch email list
```

## Complementary install

If the routed specialist skill isn't installed yet, suggest the user install it:

Skills are available locally in Cola. The four specialist skills:
- `gingiris-launch` — Product Hunt / launch
- `gingiris-opensource` — OSS / GitHub stars
- `gingiris-b2b-growth` — B2B SaaS / PLG
- `gingiris-aso-growth` — mobile / ASO

To install via skills.sh marketplace:
```bash
npx skills add Gingiris/gingiris-launch
npx skills add Gingiris/gingiris-opensource
npx skills add Gingiris/gingiris-b2b-growth
npx skills add Gingiris/gingiris-aso-growth
```

## What this skill does *not* do

- **Product/pricing advice** — if the bottleneck is product fit or pricing, say so explicitly and redirect to a product strategist (this skill only routes growth questions)
- **Paid ads tactical execution** — covered at a high level in gingiris-b2b-growth and gingiris-aso-growth, but not the primary focus
- **Fundraising / pitch deck** — out of scope
