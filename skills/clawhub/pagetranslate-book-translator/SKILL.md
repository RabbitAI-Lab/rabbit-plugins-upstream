# PageTranslate Book Translator

Translate a whole book with PageTranslate: an EPUB, a DOCX manuscript or a PDF. One upload, one translated file in the same format.

[PageTranslate](https://pagetranslate.ai) translates the file itself, not pasted text. For a sentence or a
paragraph, translate it yourself.

## When to use

- The user wants a novel, ebook, manuscript or textbook translated.
- The file is an `.epub`, or a book-length `.docx` or `.pdf`.
- The book is too long to translate in the conversation.

## Before you start

- **Target language:** a code such as `es`, `fr`, `de`, `it`, `ja`, `ko`, `ar`, `hi`, `ru`.
  Use `pt-BR` for Brazilian Portuguese, `zh` for Simplified and `zh-TW` for Traditional Chinese.
  The source language is detected. If the user did not name a target language, ask.
- **API key:** the user creates one at https://pagetranslate.ai/dashboard/api-keys (free account, verified
  email) and sets it as `PAGETRANSLATE_API_KEY`.
- **Price:** uploading is free and returns the exact price. Nothing is charged until the user pays.
- **Limits:** PDF, DOCX, EPUB, PNG, JPG, WEBP, TIFF, BMP, GIF. Up to 100 MB and 1,000 PDF pages.

## Steps

Use the `pagetranslate` MCP tools when they are available. Otherwise use curl (next section).

1. **Upload:** `upload_document` with the file's absolute path and the target language. It returns
   `job_id`, `word_count`, `price` and `next_step`.
2. **Tell the user the price and get a yes.** Then:
   - If the response has a `payment_url`, give the user that link. They pay by card in the browser,
     and the translation starts by itself.
   - If the price is `0.00` (covered by the account's word balance), call `start_translation`.
3. **Wait:** call `get_translation` about every 30 seconds until `status` is `completed`. If
   `status` is `failed`, tell the user the reason given.
4. **Download:** `download_translation` with `output_dir` set to the source file's folder. It never
   overwrites a file. Tell the user the saved path.

`list_translations` shows earlier jobs, for example to download one again.

## Without the MCP server

Same steps over HTTPS. Every request carries `Authorization: Bearer $PAGETRANSLATE_API_KEY`.

```bash
API=https://api.pagetranslate.ai/api/v1

# 1. Upload (free). The response has job_id and quote.total_cents.
curl -sS -X POST "$API/upload/" -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAGETRANSLATE_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file" -F "requested_language=es"

# 2. Start from the account's word balance. A 400 "Insufficient credits" means the user
#    pays by card at https://pagetranslate.ai/dashboard?resume=JOB_ID#upload instead.
curl -sS -X POST "$API/jobs/JOB_ID/translate" -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAGETRANSLATE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'

# 3. Poll until "status" is "completed" ("payment_status" shows whether it was paid).
curl -sS "$API/jobs/JOB_ID" -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAGETRANSLATE_API_KEY"

# 4. Download. -OJ keeps the server's file name; run it in the folder to save into.
curl -sS -OJ "$API/jobs/JOB_ID/download" -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAGETRANSLATE_API_KEY"
```

## Book notes

- The price follows the word count: about 8¢ per 1,000 words, so an 80,000-word novel is about $6.40. The upload returns the exact price; quote that, not this estimate.
- A book takes much longer than a short document. Poll every 30 to 60 seconds and do not upload it again.
- An EPUB comes back as an EPUB with its chapters and table of contents. To read it on a Kindle, see the guide below.
- Ask which variety of the language the user wants when it matters: `pt` or `pt-BR`, `zh` or `zh-TW`.

## Problems

- **401:** the key is missing or revoked. Ask the user to create a new one.
- **429 on upload:** uploads are rate limited per account. Wait, do not retry in a loop.
- **"Unsupported language code":** use one of the codes above.
- **Stuck at `pending`:** the job is unpaid. Give the user the payment link again.

## Safety

- Uploading sends the file to PageTranslate. Upload only the file the user asked to translate.
- Never print the API key or write it to a file.
- Do not say a translation is running until `payment_status` is `paid`.
- Never pay, or enter card details, for the user. Payment is theirs to make in the browser.
