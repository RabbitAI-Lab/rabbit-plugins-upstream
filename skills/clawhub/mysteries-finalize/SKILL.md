# Mysteries Finalize Protocol

This skill automates the finalization process of a Farsight video project, handling transcription, translation, and thumbnail generation.

## Trigger
Use this skill when the user asks to "run the mysteries finalize protocol", finalize a project, or prepare the final Farsight assets.

## Phase 1: Pre-flight Verification (CRITICAL)
Before starting any processing, the AI MUST verify the workspace:
1. Navigate to the project's `Renders/Final/` directory.
2. Confirm the presence of ALL three primary assets:
   - The finalized video file (`.mp4` or `.mov`)
   - The finalized audio file (`.wav` or `.mp3`)
   - The base 1080p thumbnail image (`.jpg` or `.png`)
3. If any of these are missing, pause and alert the user to place them in the folder before proceeding. The project title is inferred from these files.

## Phase 2: Audio Processing & Transcription
1. **Convert for Whisper:** Use `ffmpeg` to convert the audio to a 16kHz mono `.wav` file.
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -i "<input>" -ar 16000 -ac 1 -c:a pcm_s16le "<output_16k.wav>"
   ```
2. **Transcribe:** Run `whisper-cli` using the local `ggml-base.en.bin` model to generate:
   - A text transcript (`.txt`)
   - An English subtitle file (`.srt`)

## Phase 3: Global Localization
1. Use a Python script with the `srt` and `deep-translator` libraries to translate the English `.srt` into the 12 Farsight standard languages:
   - Arabic (`Arabic`), Chinese Simplified (`Chinese_Simplified`), German (`Deutsch`), Spanish (`Espanol`), French (`Francais`), Italian (`Italiano`), Japanese (`Japanese`), Swahili (`Kiswahili`), Korean (`Korean`), Portuguese (`Portugues`), Russian (`Russian`), Thai (`Thai`).
2. Ensure API batching and pauses are respected to avoid rate limits during translation.

## Phase 4: Smart Thumbnail Generation
1. **Locate Base Thumbnail:** Use the 1920x1080 base thumbnail verified in Phase 1.
2. **Scale & Crop:** Use a Python script utilizing `PIL.ImageOps.fit` to resize and crop the image *without* stretching or squeezing.
   - For most thumbnails, use `centering=(0.5, 1.0)` (bottom anchor) so the main title at the bottom is never cut off.
   - **Special Rule for "Featured":** For the 3840x1440 Featured thumbnail, adjust the crop anchor slightly higher (e.g., `centering=(0.5, 0.82)`) to intentionally crop out the "Only Available on Farsight Prime.com" footer text while keeping the main title in frame.
3. **Generate Targets:**
   - **Base HD:** 1920x1080, optimized to < 3MB.
   - **BIG:** 3840x2160, optimized to < 2MB.
   - **social_media:** 1200x630, optimized to 200KB - 300KB.
   - **Featured:** 3840x1440, no size limit, high quality. (Use Special Crop Rule)
   - **email:** 650x366, optimized to < 100KB.

## Phase 5: Organization & Cleanup
1. Create `Transcripts/` and `Thumbnails/` folders inside `Renders/Final/`.
2. Rename the transcript text file to `[Movie_Title]_TRANSCRIPT.txt`.
3. Rename all `.srt` files to `[Movie_Title]_[Language].srt`.
4. Prefix all generated thumbnails with `[Movie_Title]_`.
5. Move the text and SRT files into the `Transcripts/` folder.
6. Move the 5 generated thumbnails into the `Thumbnails/` folder.
