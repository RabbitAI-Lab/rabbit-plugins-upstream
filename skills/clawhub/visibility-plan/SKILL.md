description: Fingerprint one project (or a whole folder of repos) for listable assets - MCP server, Agent Skill, plugin, OpenAPI, CLI, browser extension - and rank the marketplaces and directories it can be listed on now, plus which single asset to build next to unlock the most listings.

Produce a visibility plan: where this project can get a dedicated page on a high-authority platform, what each listing needs, and the order to do them. Change nothing outside `.visibility/` in the project. Never create accounts, pay, submit forms or publish here; that is `register`, one platform at a time, with the user.

Resolve these paths from this file's directory:

- `catalog.json`: every platform: requirements (asset ids), claimed DR, cost, review, link type, effort, steps tagged `claude:` / `approve:` / `human:`, and whether the row was verified. It is the only home for platform facts.
- `scripts/scan.py`: detects assets from files and routes the catalog. `scan.py --check` validates the catalog.

## 1. Facts

Read in order, stopping when the product is clear: `.agents/product-marketing.md` (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`), the README, `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`, the landing page if a URL is given. Capture in `.visibility/PRODUCT.md` (create `.visibility/` with a `.gitignore` containing `*`):

- name, one-line pitch, audience, category, the product's character (developer tool, consumer app, B2B SaaS, AI agent, content site) and tone
- website, docs URL, signup URL, remote MCP URL, OpenAPI URL, GitHub repo
- live status: is it public and working? A listing for something unreleased or broken does harm; if it is not live, say so and stop at the plan.

## 2. Scan

Run `python3 scripts/scan.py <path>`. It detects the file-provable assets. For each `(ask)` asset, answer from PRODUCT.md or ask the user in one batched question; never guess a URL or claim an account exists. Re-run with `--have a,b,...` for the confirmed ones and save the output as `.visibility/SCAN.md`.

`--portfolio` (or several paths): pass every repo, skipping archived, scrapped or forked ones, and add `--json`. Present one matrix: repo x eligible-now count, best listing, and best unlock asset.

## 3. Plan

Write `.visibility/PLAN.md`:

1. **Now**: eligible rows, ranked by the scan (DR over effort). For each: what Claude prepares, what the user must do (`human:` steps), cost, and `verified: no` rows flagged "re-check the live page first". Rows with no DR rank as if DR 50; show them as "DR unknown", never as a measured figure.
2. **Build next**: the scan's "one asset away" list, as a recommendation of at most two assets, with what building each takes and who builds it: an MCP server via `mcp-server-dev:build-mcp-server` or `anthropic-skills:mcp-builder`, a SKILL.md via `anthropic-skills:skill-creator`, an OpenAPI file from the existing routes, a one-job browser extension or CLI around the public API. Only recommend an asset that serves real users of this product; a listing is not a reason to build something off-brand.
3. **Generic directories**: launch, AI, SaaS and review directories (Product Hunt, TAAFT, G2, MCP.so...) belong to `marketingskills:directory-submissions`. Point to it; do not list them here.
4. **Skip**: rows that do not fit the product's character, with the reason.

End with a ledger at `.visibility/LEDGER.csv` using the columns of `marketingskills:directory-submissions` `references/submission-tracker-template.csv` if installed, else `platform,status,listing_url,link_rel,date,notes`; one row per Now item with status `planned`.

Done when PLAN.md exists, every `(ask)` asset is answered or marked unknown, and the user has the top three next actions in your reply. Next step: `/visibility:register <platform-id>`.
