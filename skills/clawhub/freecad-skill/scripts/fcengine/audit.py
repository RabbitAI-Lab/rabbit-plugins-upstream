"""Document-wide integrity audit, run around every edit.

Creation-time checks (cut removed nothing, fusion fell apart, empty
result) only see the feature being created. Later edits to its inputs
(set, move, rotate, place, set_params, python) can break it silently, so the
runner audits all features before and after each edit. Conditions that
are *new* after the edit are reported: an empty result is an error (the
request rolls back), and no-effect or disjoint booleans are warnings.
