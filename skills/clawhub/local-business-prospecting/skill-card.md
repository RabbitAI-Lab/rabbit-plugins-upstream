### Deployment Geography for Use:

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Prospecting queries, target URLs, and public business data are sent to Crawlora.

Mitigation: Use only public business information, keep private customer data out of criteria, and confirm this data sharing is acceptable before use.

Risk: An exposed API key could allow unauthorized use.

Mitigation: Keep the Crawlora API key in an environment variable and do not paste it into prompts or prospecting criteria.

Risk: Business details may be stale, incomplete, or incorrectly matched across providers.

Mitigation: Check source pages and refresh status, preserve uncertainty, and review the shortlist before outreach or CRM import.
