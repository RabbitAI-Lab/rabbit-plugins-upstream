## Description:

Turn contractor-supplied project names, unit names, and handover dates into three handover sign stills, then turn the rest of that project into a matching set.

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

## Publisher:

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Contractors, general contractors, supervisors, and their agents use this skill to turn confirmed project names, unit names, dates, and sign titles into a staged set of matching project handover sign stills. It supports pack planning, cost confirmation, Beatra image generation calls, task recovery, review, and delivery.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: The skill stores a shared full-scope Beatra device token in local ~/.beatra state.

Mitigation: Install only when broad Beatra account access is acceptable, protect the local credential files, and revoke the device from the Beatra Console when it is no longer needed.

Risk: The bundled client silently checks for and applies package self-updates by default.

Mitigation: Use the documented update --auto off command to disable silent update checks when automatic replacement is not acceptable.

Risk: Remote image generation is billable and runs through Beatra-hosted tasks and uploads.

Mitigation: Confirm costs before paid calls, use stable client_request_id values for recovery, poll existing tasks, and avoid resubmitting uncertain requests.
