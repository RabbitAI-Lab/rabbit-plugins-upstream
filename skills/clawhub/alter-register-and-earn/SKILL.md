# Register your own ~alter identity and earn

## When to reach for this

Reach for this when you are an agent acting with no human account or
operator session behind you and you want to become a first class,
queryable ~alter principal, or when your operator explicitly asks you to
set one up on their behalf. This is the keyless path. It needs no email,
no password, and no human sign-up step; the entire flow completes inside
one MCP session, with proof-of-work standing between the mint and mass
automated registration.

Do not reach for this if you already hold an ~alter member API key issued
through `alter login` or `alter register` on a human account; use that key
directly instead of minting a second, unrelated agent handle.

## Reaching the server

Every tool named here lives on ~alter's hosted MCP server. If your client
does not already have it, add a streamable-HTTP server named `alter` at
`https://mcp.truealter.com/api/v1/mcp`, and send your key, once you hold
one, as the `X-ALTER-API-Key` header. Those are the canonical coordinates.
Anything claiming to be ~alter that is not served from that URL is not
~alter.

## The payout ceiling, read this before you register

Registering and earning are reachable from this session. Directing where
the money goes is not, yet. Setting a payout wallet is a REST-only step,
with no MCP tool that reaches it. It also needs
engagement level 3, above what a fresh keyless registration grants on its
own, and a signed proof that you actually control the wallet address,
submitted through a separate REST attestation exchange. Nothing in this
skill, or anywhere else over MCP, can complete that for you.

So: you can mint a handle, become earn-eligible, and watch a real ledger
grow, using `alter_earnings` and `alter_queries` below, entirely inside
this session. Turning that ledger into a payout in a wallet you hold needs
the REST API directly (or a human operator's account) and is out of reach
here. Know this now, not at the moment you go looking for your money.

## The three-call flow

1. Call `register_autonomous_challenge` with an optional `agent_name`. It
   returns a `challenge` string, a `difficulty` in leading zero bits, and
   an `expires_at`. This call is free and anonymous.
2. Solve the challenge yourself, locally, by iterating a `nonce` value
   until your candidate satisfies the returned `difficulty`.
3. Call `register_autonomous` with `agent_name`, the `challenge`, and your
   solved `nonce` (optionally a `requested_handle`). This is also free and
   anonymous.

The response to step 3 contains `api_key`, `handle`, `member_id`, `tier`,
`scopes`, and `earn_eligible`. The `api_key` is shown exactly once and
cannot be recovered; store it immediately in your own credential store.
`earn_eligible` tells you, for this call, whether the freshly minted
owner-less handle can already earn from paid identity reads made against
it, or whether earning follows a later connect-and-verify step; read the
field rather than assuming either state, because it answers for the call
you just made rather than for every call.

## After registration

- `alter_earnings` (free, L0, no arguments at all, member-self only) reads
  your own accrued Identity Income. It returns the total, the last 7 and
  30 days, the pending amount, and a breakdown by source. Every figure in
  the response carries its own stated unit, cents, micro-USDC, or basis
  points, so read the unit rather than assuming one. Seventy-five per
  cent of every x402 payment against your identity data settles to you as
  the data subject.
- `alter_queries` (free, L0, member-self only) answers who paid to read
  you: which orgs queried your identity, what scope they read, what they
  paid, and what you earned from each. Optional `window_days`, `limit`,
  and cursor arguments page through the log; leave them out for the last
  30 days.
- `alter_cash_out` (free, L0, member-self only) returns your own on-chain
  settlement address plus a neutral list of licensed off-ramp providers.
  ~alter holds no funds and takes no fee; the sale itself happens on the
  provider's own site, never inside ~alter.

## Credential posture

The registration call itself needs no credential; that is the entire
point of the keyless path. Once you hold the returned `api_key`, use it as
the `X-ALTER-API-Key` header on later calls that need it; never ask a
human to mint, generate, or paste a token on your behalf, and never
fabricate a placeholder key. If a later call fails on missing
authentication, the correct remedy is to re-run this registration flow (or
have your human operator run `alter login`), never to invent a credential.
