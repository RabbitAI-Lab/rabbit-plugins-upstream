## Description: <br>
Local PII protection for OpenClaw agents that scrubs customer data before it reaches any AI model using local Microsoft Presidio containers. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and operators use this skill to check local Presidio health, pseudonymize customer PII from CRM, cloud-drive, and project-management data before model use, and restore tokenized responses locally before delivery. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Raw customer data is sent to Presidio endpoints controlled by PRESIDIO_ANALYZER_URL and PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZER_URL. <br>
Mitigation: Bind Presidio to localhost and verify those environment variables are not set to remote services before use. <br>
Risk: Sensitive token-to-PII mapping files are stored locally during reversible pseudonymization. <br>
Mitigation: Use a controlled mapping directory, simple session IDs such as timestamps or UUIDs without slashes, and periodically remove stale mapping files. <br>
Risk: The server security verdict requires review before deployment. <br>
Mitigation: Install only when local PII scrubbing is needed and the runtime, container bindings, and mapping storage can be controlled. <br>
