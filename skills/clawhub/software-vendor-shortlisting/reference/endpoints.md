# software-vendor-shortlisting — endpoint reference

> Generated from `scripts/tools.json` by `scripts/generate.mjs` — do not edit by hand.

Only the endpoints used by this workflow. Call them via `scripts/crawlora.sh` (see SKILL.md).

All paths are relative to the API base `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1` and require the header `x-api-key: $CRAWLORA_API_KEY`. Path params like `{id}` are substituted into the URL; `GET` params go in the query string; `POST` params go in a JSON body.

**8 endpoints across 4 platform group(s).**

## Capterra (3)

### `capterra_product`

- **HTTP:** `GET /capterra/product`
- **What:** Get a Capterra product. Returns a Capterra product profile: name, description, category, and aggregate rating.
- **Params:** `product_id` (string, **required**) — Capterra product id (the numeric id in a /p/{id}/{slug}/ URL)

### `capterra_reviews`

- **HTTP:** `GET /capterra/product/reviews`
- **What:** Get Capterra product reviews. Returns a page of Capterra reviews (author, headline, rating) plus the product's aggregate rating.
- **Params:** `page` (integer, optional) — Page number (default 1); `product_id` (string, **required**) — Capterra product id (the numeric id in a /p/{id}/{slug}/ URL)

### `capterra_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /capterra/search`
- **What:** Search Capterra products. Returns Capterra search-result products (id, name, url, description, rating). Note: Capterra renders a fallback product list even for queries with no genuine match, rather than a distinct empty-results page, so callers should treat low-relevance results as an upstream characteristic, not a bug.
- **Params:** `q` (string, **required**) — Search query

## ProductHunt (3)

### `producthunt_alternatives`

- **HTTP:** `GET /producthunt/product/{id}/alternatives`
- **What:** Retrieve Product Hunt product alternatives. Lists alternatives to a Product Hunt product, looked up by its slug in `id`. `first` sets the page size (default 10), `order` defaults to `most_relevant`, and `tags` takes comma-separated tag slugs. Returns alternative items with ratings, badges and scores, alternative tags with counts, and related discussions. Use `end_cursor` as `cursor` for the next page.
- **Params:** `cursor` (string, optional) — Pagination cursor; `first` (integer, optional) — Page size; `id` (string, **required**) — Product Hunt slug; `order` (string, optional) — Sort order; `tags` (string, optional) — Comma-separated tag slugs

### `producthunt_product`

- **HTTP:** `GET /producthunt/product/{id}`
- **What:** Retrieve Product Hunt product details. Returns the core Product Hunt product details. The path takes an exact Product Hunt slug; if you only know the product name, look the slug up first with `/producthunt/search` (live) or `/datasets/producthunt-products/search` (indexed). Unknown slugs return 404, and that 404 is cached for one hour.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Product Hunt slug or numeric ID

### `producthunt_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /producthunt/search`
- **What:** Search for products, users, or launches on Product Hunt. Searches Product Hunt for the required `query`. `type` is `product` (default), `user` or `launch`, and `page` starts at 1. `featured` and `topics` apply to launch search only. Results come as `edges` with `pageInfo` and `pagesCount`; launch search also returns topic aggregations.
- **Params:** `featured` (boolean, optional) — Launch search only: featured launches only; `page` (integer, optional) — Page number (1-based); `query` (string, **required**) — Search keywords; `topics` (string, optional) — Launch search only: comma-separated topic slugs; `type` (string, optional) — Result type: **product** (default), **user**, or **launch**

## Bing (1)

### `bing_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /bing/search`
- **What:** Search Bing web results. Returns Bing web search results for a query string, including organic results, optional context panel data, related queries, people-also-ask questions, news modules, video modules, and page-based pagination. Empty optional blocks are omitted from the JSON response. Locale defaults to country=us and lang=en-us. Returns 503 on a genuine transport failure or challenge page. Bing occasionally serves a well-formed page whose results share no significant term with the query; when every attempt hits this, the response is still returned as 200 with data.low_confidence set to true (and the X-Low-Confidence header) instead of being withheld, so callers get Bing's real answer plus an honest signal to double-check it rather than nothing. Queries that use the site: operator (for example site:gov.hu) are not supported: Bing serves a bot-verification challenge for them, so they are rejected with 400 before any request is made. Use the DuckDuckGo (/api/v1/duckduckgo/search), Brave (/api/v1/brave/search), or Yahoo (/api/v1/yahoo-search/search) search endpoints for domain-restricted searches instead.
- **Params:** `count` (integer, optional) — Results per page; defaults to 10, clamped to 1..50; `country` (string, optional) — Two-letter country code; defaults to us; `lang` (string, optional) — Bing UI language; defaults to en-us; `page` (integer, optional) — 1-based page number; defaults to 1; `q` (string, **required**) — Search query

## Web (1)

### `web_scrape`

- **HTTP:** `POST /web/scrape`
- **What:** Scrape a URL into markdown, HTML, links or metadata. Fetches a single public URL and returns clean content in the requested formats (markdown, html, raw_html, links, metadata). The request body IS the ScrapeOption object itself — e.g. {"url": "https://example.com"} — do not wrap it in an extra key. With render=auto the request starts as a fast HTTP fetch and escalates to a real browser when the page is blocked or rendered with JavaScript. only_main_content (default true) strips navigation, headers, footers and other boilerplate before conversion. Only public pages are supported; respect each site's terms of use and robots directives. A handful of popular sites (Amazon, Reddit, Yelp, LinkedIn, and others) already have a dedicated, more reliable endpoint elsewhere in this API — a failed scrape against one of them names it. A Reddit URL that maps onto a dedicated Reddit endpoint (listings, search, comment threads, user and domain pages) is answered by that endpoint instead, and its response is returned as-is in data with an X-Routed-To header; send dedicated=false to always get the scraped page.
- **Params:** `scrapeOption` (object, **required**) — Scrape options
- **REST body:** Send the value of the MCP argument `scrapeOption` directly as the JSON body; do not wrap it in a `scrapeOption` property.
