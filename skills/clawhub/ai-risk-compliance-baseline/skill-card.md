### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Small teams and business operators use this skill to create an AI Use Register and apply a seven-item baseline checklist to AI tools and agents that handle business data or produce external outputs.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Users could treat the checklist as proof of legal compliance or rely on outdated legal requirements.

Mitigation: Use it as a planning checklist; verify current laws, regulator guidance, and vendor terms before making compliance decisions.

Risk: Client records, secrets, or identifiable incident examples could be exposed while assessing AI use.

Mitigation: Share data categories rather than client records or secrets, and redact saved incident examples.

Risk: Untrusted content or excessive agent permissions could lead to unsafe tool actions.

Mitigation: Apply least privilege and keep untrusted content from directly driving tool calls.
