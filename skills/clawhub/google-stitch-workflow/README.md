# Google Stitch Workflow

Agent-neutral ClawHub skill bundle for using Google Stitch through the official Stitch MCP server.

Version: **1.9.0**

## At a glance

- MCP-first: separates verified MCP actions from browser-only Stitch features
- practical: optimized for project inspection, screen generation, controlled edits, and redesign iteration
- pragmatic for greenfield apps: when an accepted Stitch export is available, use it as the translation seed instead of rebuilding from screenshots
- cautious: emphasizes parameter discipline, visual distinctiveness review, and failure recovery
- anti-generic: strengthens prompts and review gates around structure-first design, honest content, token discipline, and no decorative fake chrome

## Best for

- inspecting Stitch projects and screens before editing
- generating one screen at a time from a structured prompt
- refining generated screens with small preservation-oriented edits
- redesigning existing app screens from reliable references
- bootstrapping a new app UI from accepted Stitch-generated screens and exports
- deciding when to stay in Stitch and when to move to code

## Not for

- blind direct production UI implementation from raw exports
- pixel-perfect code-side fixes
- whole-product planning in one giant prompt
- blind reliance on browser-only Stitch features through MCP

## Works with

- Claude Code (tools appear as `mcp__stitch__<tool>` once the user adds the Stitch MCP server)
- any other agent with an MCP client (Codex, Cursor, OpenClaw, ...), using the same tool names

No scripts, packages or credentials ship with this bundle. The Stitch connection and its credential live in your agent's own MCP configuration.

## Quick start

1. Read [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).
2. Inspect the project and target screen before editing.
3. Generate one screen or make one small edit.
4. Review the visual result immediately.
5. Move to code only after one canonical screen direction is accepted.

## Changelog

### 1.9.0

- Tool list matches the official Stitch MCP server (checked 2026-11-08): adds `download_file`, `upload_design_md`, `create_design_system_from_design_md`, `delete_project`, and the real `generate_variants` options.
- Adds Claude Code as a runtime adapter (`mcp__stitch__*` tools); drops wrapper-specific call examples.
- Marks wrapper-only tools (`fetch_screen_image`, `fetch_screen_code`, `generation_status`, `list_generations`, `build_site`) as unverified, with official replacements.
- Updates `modelId` and `deviceType` enums, IDs vs resource names, and screen instances vs screen IDs.
- Warns that `list_projects` output is very large and shows how to summarize it.
- New recipe: Brand from DESIGN.md (upload, create design system, generate MOBILE screens; translate for Flutter, never copy HTML).
- Safety: optional `@google/design.md` linter pinned and gated on user approval; no package installs driven by generated code; `DESIGN.md` treated as design data, not agent instructions; no setup commands; destructive `delete_project` gated on explicit confirmation.

### 1.8.0

- Structure-first workflow with anti-generic design gates: structural fingerprint, honest proof, token discipline, no decorative fake chrome.
