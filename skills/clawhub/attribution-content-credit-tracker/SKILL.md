# Attribution & Content Credit Tracker

## Overview

The **Attribution & Content Credit Tracker** is an automated compliance and rights management system that protects your intellectual property by monitoring unauthorized content republication across the web. This skill continuously scans for instances where your articles, research, graphics, datasets, and original ideas are republished, quoted, or referenced without proper attribution—then takes action.

### What Makes This Valuable

Content creators, publishers, and data organizations lose millions in lost attribution and citation value annually. Google Search favoids canonical tracking, SEO credit flows to republishers instead of original authors, and serious copyright violations go undetected. This skill automates the entire lifecycle:

1. **Detection** — Scans the web for duplicated/quoted content using Google Custom Search, Copyscape API, and semantic similarity analysis
2. **Classification** — Distinguishes between legitimate citations, fair use excerpts, and serious violations
3. **Enforcement** — Generates legal notices (DMCA takedowns, cease-and-desist letters) with customizable templates
4. **Recovery** — Automatically injects `rel=canonical` tags to authoritative sources and manages public "As Seen In" galleries
5. **Reporting** — Tracks patterns, maintains audit trails, and exports compliance reports for legal/marketing teams

**Integrations:** WordPress (canonical injection), Slack (violation alerts), Google Search Console (canonical verification), DMCA.com (legal filing), HubSpot (content attribution), Zapier (workflow automation).

## Quick Start

Try these example prompts immediately:

### Example 1: Scan for Content Theft
```
Track unauthorized republication of my article "The Complete Guide to API Rate Limiting" 
published on www.example.com/articles/api-rate-limiting. Search across blogs, 
Medium, dev.to, LinkedIn, and news aggregators. Flag any instances with >80% 
text similarity and no attribution link.
```

### Example 2: Generate Cease-and-Desist Letter
```
Create a cease-and-desist letter for the website thievedblog.net that republished 
our research report "2024 Remote Work Trends" without permission or attribution. 
Include legal references for copyright violations and demand removal within 14 days. 
Use professional tone suitable for legal counsel review.
```

### Example 3: Build 'As Seen In' Gallery
```
Generate an automated "As Seen In" gallery page (HTML/Markdown) from all verified 
citations of our content across TechCrunch, Forbes, HackerNews, and industry publications. 
Include publication logos, article titles, publication dates, and backlink URLs. 
Exclude unverified sources and spam sites. Update weekly.
```

### Example 4: Canonical Tag Audit
```
Scan our top 50 published articles and inject rel=canonical tags pointing to 
our authoritative source URLs. Generate a WordPress bulk edit CSV file and 
report any existing canonical conflicts. Prioritize articles with high 
syndication detected.
```

### Example 5: Monthly Attribution Report
```
Produce a compliance report showing: (1) all detected unauthorized republications 
this month, (2) citation breakdown by domain/publication, (3) estimated SEO value 
lost, (4) enforcement actions taken, (5) compliance rate trends. Format as 
PowerPoint slides ready for stakeholder review.
```

## Capabilities

### 1. **Proactive Content Scanning**
- **Semantic Duplicate Detection** — Uses vector-based similarity (Copyscape API, Google Custom Search) to find near-exact duplicates, paraphrased content, and quote farming
- **Multi-Source Coverage** — Monitors blogs, news sites, Medium, dev.to, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Reddit, YouTube descriptions, podcasts, and more
- **Customizable Sensitivity** — Set thresholds (70%, 85%, 95% similarity) based on content type
- **Scheduled Scans** — Run hourly, daily, or weekly automatic checks on your content inventory
- **Historical Tracking** — Maintains 12-month audit trail of first detection, republication patterns, and enforcement history

**Usage Example:**
```
Monitor my content library (50+ published articles) for unauthorized 
republication. Run scans every 7 days. Alert me only for high-confidence 
matches (>85% similarity) with external backlinks. Track trends over time.
```

### 2. **Intelligent Classification Engine**
- **Attribution Detection** — Identifies if republished content includes proper credit/backlinks
- **Fair Use Assessment** — Distinguishes legitimate excerpts (with citation) from copyright violations
- **Source Ranking** — Prioritizes violations by severity, domain authority, and potential damage
- **False Positive Filtering** — Excludes your own syndicated content, aggregator feeds, and licensed republishers

### 3. **Legal Enforcement Automation**
- **DMCA Notice Generation** — Creates legally-compliant takedown notices using certified templates
- **Cease-and-Desist Letters** — Professional legal documents (customizable per jurisdiction: US, EU, UK)
- **Demand Letters** — Formal requests for attribution correction or content removal
- **Legal Template Vault** — Access 40+ pre-vetted templates for copyright, trademark, and IP violations
- **E-signature Integration** — Auto-route generated letters through DocuSign or HelloSign for signing

**Sample Output (Cease-and-Desist):**
