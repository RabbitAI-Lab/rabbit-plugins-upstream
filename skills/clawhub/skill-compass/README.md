| **What it is** | A local-first skill quality evaluator and management tool for Claude Code / OpenClaw. Six-dimension scoring, usage-driven suggestions, guided improvement, version tracking. |
| **Pain it solves** | Turns "tweak and hope" into diagnose → targeted fix → verified improvement. Turns "install and forget" into ongoing visibility over what's working, what's stale, and what's risky. |
| **Use in 30 seconds** | `/skillcompass` — see your skill health at a glance. `/eval-skill {path}` — instant quality report showing exactly what's weakest and what to improve next. |

> **Evaluate → find weakest link → fix it → prove it worked → next weakness → repeat.**
> **Meanwhile, Skill Inbox watches your usage and tells you what needs attention.**

## Who This Is For

<table>
<tr><td width="50%">

**For**
- Anyone maintaining agent skills and wanting measurable quality
- Developers who want directed improvement — not guesswork, but knowing exactly which dimension to fix next
- Teams needing a quality gate — any tool that edits a skill gets auto-evaluated
- Users who install many skills and need visibility over what's actually used, what's stale, and what's risky

</td><td>

**Not For**
- General code review or runtime debugging
- Creating new skills from scratch (use skill-creator)
- Evaluating non-skill files

</td></tr>
</table>

---

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** Claude Opus 4.6 (complex reasoning + consistent scoring) &middot; Node.js v18+ (local validators)

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evol-ai/SkillCompass.git
cd SkillCompass && npm install

# User-level (all projects)
rsync -a --exclude='.git'  . ~/.claude/skills/skill-compass/

# Or project-level (current project only)
rsync -a --exclude='.git'  . .claude/skills/skill-compass/
```

> **First run:** SkillCompass auto-triggers a brief onboarding — scans your installed skills (~5 seconds), offers statusLine setup, then hands control back. Claude Code will request permission for `node` commands; select **"Allow always"** to avoid repeated prompts.

### OpenClaw

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Evol-ai/SkillCompass.git
cd SkillCompass && npm install
# Follow OpenClaw skill installation docs for your setup
rsync -a --exclude='.git'  . <your-openclaw-skills-path>/skill-compass/
```

If your OpenClaw skills live outside the default scan roots, add them to `skills.load.extraDirs` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "load": {
      "extraDirs": ["<your-openclaw-skills-path>"]
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Usage

`/skillcompass` is the single entry point. Use it with a slash command or just talk naturally — both work:

```
/skillcompass                              → see what needs attention
/skillcompass evaluate my-skill            → six-dimension quality report
"improve the nano-banana skill"            → fix weakest dimension, verify, next
"what skills haven't I used recently?"     → usage-based insights
"security scan this skill"                 → D3 security deep-dive
```

## What It Does

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/skill-quality-report.png" alt="SkillCompass — Skill Quality Report" width="380" />
</p>

The score isn't the point — **the direction is.** You instantly see which dimension is the bottleneck and what to do about it.

Each `/eval-improve` round follows a closed loop: **fix the weakest → re-evaluate → verify improvement → next weakest**. No fix is saved unless the re-evaluation confirms it actually helped.

## Six-Dimension Evaluation Model

| ID | Dimension | Weight | What it evaluates |
|:--:|-----------|:------:|-------------------|
| **D1** | Structure | 10% | Frontmatter validity, markdown format, declarations |
| **D2** | Trigger | 15% | Activation quality, rejection accuracy, discoverability |
| **D3** | Security | 20% | Secrets, injection, permissions, exfiltration, embedded shell |
| **D4** | Functional | 30% | Core quality, edge cases, output stability, error handling |
| **D5** | Comparative | 15% | Value over direct prompting (with vs without skill) |
| **D6** | Uniqueness | 10% | Overlap with similar skills, model supersession risk |

```
overall_score = round((D1×0.10 + D2×0.15 + D3×0.20 + D4×0.30 + D5×0.15 + D6×0.10) × 10)
```

| Verdict | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| **PASS** | score >= 70 AND D3 pass |
| **CAUTION** | 50–69, or D3 High findings |
| **FAIL** | score < 50, or D3 Critical (gate override) |

## Skill Inbox — Usage-Driven Suggestions

SkillCompass passively tracks which skills you actually use and surfaces suggestions when something needs attention — unused skills, stale evaluations, declining usage, available updates, and more. 9 built-in rules, all based on real invocation data.

- Suggestions have a lifecycle: **pending → acted / snoozed / dismissed**, with auto-reactivation when conditions change
- All data stays local — no network calls unless you explicitly request updates
- Tracking is automatic via hooks (~one line per skill invocation), zero configuration

---

## Features

### Evaluate → Improve → Verify

`/eval-skill` scores six dimensions and pinpoints the weakest. `/eval-improve` targets that dimension, applies a fix, and re-evaluates — only saves when the target dimension improved and security/functionality didn't regress. Then move to the next weakness.

### Skill Lifecycle

SkillCompass covers the full lifecycle of your skills — not just one-time evaluation.

**Install** — auto-scans your inventory, quick-checks security patterns across packages and sub-skills.

**Ongoing** — usage hooks passively track every invocation. Skill Inbox turns this into actionable insights: which skills are never used, which are declining, which are heavily used but never evaluated, which have updates available.

**On edit** — hooks auto-check structure + security on every SKILL.md write through Claude. Catches injection, exfiltration, embedded shell. Warns, never blocks.

**On change** — SHA-256 snapshots ensure any version is recoverable. D3 or D4 regresses after improvement? Snapshot restored automatically.

**On update** — update checker reads local git state passively; network only when you ask. Three-way merge preserves your local improvements region-by-region.

### Scale

One skill or fifty — same workflow. `/eval-audit` scans a whole directory and ranks results worst-first so you fix what matters most. `/eval-evolve` chains multiple improve rounds automatically (default 6, stops at PASS or plateau). `--ci` flag outputs machine-readable JSON with exit codes for pipeline integration.

## Works With Everything

No point-to-point integration needed. The Pre-Accept Gate intercepts all SKILL.md edits regardless of source.

| Tool | How it works together | Guide |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| **Claudeception** | Extracts skill → auto-evaluation catches security holes + redundancy → directed fix | [guide](examples/guide-claudeception.md) |
| **Self-Improving Agent** | Logs errors → feed as signals → SkillCompass maps to dimensions and fixes | [guide](examples/guide-self-improving-agent.md) |

---

## Design Principles

- **Local-first**: All data stays on your machine. No network calls except when you explicitly request updates.
- **Read-only by default**: Evaluation and reporting are read-only. Write operations (improve, merge, rollback) require explicit opt-in.
- **Passive tracking, active decisions**: Hooks collect usage data silently. Suggestions are surfaced, never auto-acted on.
- **Dual-channel UX**: Keyboard-selectable choices for actions, natural language for queries. Both always available.

## Feedback Signal Standard

SkillCompass defines an open `feedback-signal.json` schema for any tool to report skill usage data:

```bash
/eval-skill ./my-skill/SKILL.md --feedback ./feedback-signals.json
```

Signals: `trigger_accuracy`, `correction_count`, `correction_patterns`, `adoption_rate`, `ignore_rate`, `usage_frequency`. The schema is extensible (`additionalProperties: true`) — any pipeline can produce or consume this format.
