### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT-0 <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and agent users use this skill to configure agents to query, record, review, and consolidate local memory across sessions with a cortex-engine MCP server. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Agents may persist secrets, credentials, personal data, or confidential project details in local memory. <br>
Mitigation: Avoid storing sensitive data, and periodically review or prune stored memories. <br>
Risk: The skill depends on a separately installed cortex-engine npm package and MCP server. <br>
Mitigation: Verify the package and provided integrity checksum before running the MCP server. <br>
