# tradebee

> Version: 26.8.24

## Overview

This skill merges multiple Tradebee Website Builder Open API capabilities into a single publishable skill.

For all `*_update` actions, this skill does more than send a Tradebee update request:

- It reads the current record first.
- It writes a local JSON backup file under `backups/<action>/` relative to the current installed skill root.
- It returns backup metadata, the raw read response, the extracted snapshot, and a best-effort `restore_payload` on success.
- The local backup file also keeps `confirmation_summary`, `requested_update_payload`, and `restore_limitations` together with that backup data.

All future Tradebee capabilities added in this repository must be exposed through `tradebee` rather than published as separate primary skills.

This skill should be selected by the user's expected result, not only by API name.

Only route into this skill after the Tradebee data domain and object type are explicit.

- Do not trigger this skill for generic requests such as "find", "show", "check", "update", or "delete" when Tradebee platform data is not clearly the target.
- For `*_update` and `*_delete`, require one explicit Tradebee object type plus one explicit record ID or explicitly confirmed ID list before routing.
- For `*_read`, still choose the narrowest valid Tradebee filter instead of broad listing when the user already gave an exact ID, group, keyword, or IP.

When the user speaks in natural language such as "find the Tradebee product", "show Tradebee products under this category", "read one exact Tradebee blog", "open this custom page", "look at recent Tradebee inquiries", "see which Tradebee keywords are ranking in the top 100", or "delete these Tradebee products", map that request to the matching `action` below and choose the narrowest valid filter.

Supported actions:

- `languages-get`
- `rule-get`

## HTML Fragment Rules

Before generating any HTML fragment for:

- `navigation.content`
- `news.description`
- `blog.description`
- `faq.answer`
- `products.description`
- `productsgroup.section.top`
- `productsgroup.section.bottom`
- `custompage.content`

first call `rule-get` with:

- the exact selected `language`
- the exact matching `scene`

`rule-get` call requirements:

- `language` is required
- `scene` is required
- use the exact `language` value already selected for the create or update action
- do not guess, translate, normalize, or replace the `language` value
- do not invent, shorten, translate, or rename any `scene` value
- use only the fixed scene mapping below. Do not call the current frontend website domain for this rule API.

Minimal request body:

```json
{
  "action": "rule-get",
  "language": "en",
  "scene": "products.description"
}
```

Example request pattern:

```json
{
  "action": "rule-get",
  "language": "en",
  "scene": "products.description"
}
```

Required execution order:

1. Select the exact site `language` first.
2. Select the exact fixed `scene` that matches the target HTML field.
3. Call `rule-get`.
4. Generate the HTML fragment only after `rule-get` returns successfully.

Failure rule:

- If `rule-get` fails, do not continue by guessing colors, fonts, links, layout, or other fragment rules.
- Stop and report the rule-call failure instead of generating a fragment from assumptions.

Scene mapping:

- `navigation.content` -> `scene=navigation.content`
- `news.description` -> `scene=news.description`
- `blog.description` -> `scene=blog.description`
- `faq.answer` -> `scene=faq.answer`
- `products.description` -> `scene=products.description`
- `productsgroup.section.top` -> `scene=productsgroup.section.top`
- `productsgroup.section.bottom` -> `scene=productsgroup.section.bottom`
- `custompage.content` -> `scene=custompage.content`

The generated fragment must follow the returned rule payload, especially:

- use the exact selected language only
- follow the full returned rule payload, not only part of it
- do not guess, replace, shorten, rename, or partially ignore returned rule fields
- do not hardcode assumptions in this skill about future rule details; the `rule-get` response is the source of truth

## Quick Routing Guide

Choose the action by the user's actual goal and the result they expect to see.

### Result-First Routing

- If the user wants to know "what exists", prefer a `*_read` action.
- If the user wants to "add new content", prefer a `*_create` action.
- If the user wants to "change existing content", prefer a `*_update` action.
- If the user wants to "remove existing content", prefer a `*_delete` action.
- If the user asks for analytics, visit history, inquiry records, or keyword performance, prefer the specialized read action instead of any content action.

### How Users Usually Ask

- "show one", "check one", "list them", "see whether it exists", "find this", "read one"
  Route these to the matching `*_read` action.
- "add new", "create", "publish", "add"
  Route these to the matching `*_create` action.
- "modify", "edit", "update", "adjust"
  Route these to the matching `*_update` action.
- "delete", "move to recycle bin", "remove"
  Route these to the matching `*_delete` action.
- "recent visits", "visitor IP", "keyword ranking", "inquiry records"
  Route these to `visitor-recent`, `keywords-rank`, or `inquiry-read` instead of blog or product actions.

  - "List FAQ groups"
  - "Read one exact FAQ group"
  - "Show FAQ categories"
  - "what FAQ categories are there"
  - "check this FAQ category"

  - "List custom pages"
  - "Find one exact custom page"
  - "show custom page details"
- Use `custompage-create` when the user asks:

  - "Update custom page 123"
  - "Edit custom page content"
  - "Change custom page SEO"
- Use `custompage-delete` when the user asks:
  - "Delete custom page 123"
  - "Move these custom pages to recycle bin"

### News Operations

- Use `news-read` to list news, read one exact article, or filter by news group.
- Use `news-create` to publish a new news article under a group selected from `newsgroup-read`.
- Use `news-update` to edit one exact news record; it reads and backs up the current record first.
- Use `news-delete` only for an explicitly confirmed news ID list.

### News Group Operations

- Use `newsgroup-read` to list groups or obtain one exact group ID.
- Use `newsgroup-create` to create a news group.
- Use `newsgroup-update` to edit one exact group with automatic backup.
- Use `newsgroup-delete` only for an explicitly confirmed group ID list.

### Website Navigation Operations

- Use `navigation-read` to read the complete two-level tree without pagination or to select an exact navigation ID.
- Use `navigation-create` to add first- or second-level navigation. Second-level parents must have `is_leaf=false`.
- Use `navigation-update` to edit one item without changing its parent; it reads and backs up the item first.
- Use `navigation-delete` only after confirming that deleting a first-level item also deletes all children.
- Internal navigation URLs must omit scheme and domain. System navigation, custom HTML children, and manual second-level navigation are mutually exclusive.
- Interpret `system_children_type` exactly as: `0` disabled, `1` first-level product groups, `2` news groups, `3` FAQ groups, `4` certificate groups, `5` case groups, `6` all product groups without cover images, and `7` blog groups. Values `1`–`7` are first-level only and require empty `content` with no manually added children.
- `content` is a first-level custom child-navigation HTML fragment. Follow the `navigation.content` payload returned by `rule-get`: use one root `<section>` with a unique scoped class and one embedded `<style>` block at the end. Inline `style="..."` attributes and external stylesheet links are forbidden. Do not include `<h1>`; `<h2>`–`<h6>` are preferred. It supports up to 50 HTTP(S)-URL or `data:image/...;base64,...` images of at most 500 kB each. The 100,000-character limit is calculated after removing `<img>` tags; the server uploads base64 images and replaces their `src` values with URLs. Non-empty `content` requires `system_children_type=0` and no manual children. System children, manual-child mode, and every second-level item require empty content. On update, an empty string or omitted field does not update the current value.

  - "Read products"
  - "List product data"
  - "Find one exact product"
  - "Show products under this group"

  - "Update product 123"
  - "Modify product content"
  - "Move a product to another group"
- Use `products-delete` when the user asks:
  - "Delete product 123"
  - "Move these products to recycle bin"

### Product Group Operations

- Use `productsgroup-read` when the user asks:
  - "List product groups"
  - "Read top-level product groups"
  - "Read child groups under this parent"
  - "Find one exact product group"
  - "what product categories are there"
  - "what child categories are under this parent category"
- Use `productsgroup-create` when the user asks:
  - "Create a product group"

- Use `productsgroup-update` when the user asks:
  - "Update product group 456"

  - "Read inquiries"
  - "List leads"
  - "Show recent inquiry records"
  - "what recent inquiries are there"
  - "help me check recent customer messages"
- Use `visitor-recent` when the user asks:

## Selection Principles

- Prefer `*-read` only when the user explicitly wants to read or analyze existing Tradebee records and the Tradebee object type is already clear.
- Prefer `*-create` only when the user explicitly wants to create new Tradebee content and the target Tradebee object type is already clear.
- Prefer `*-update` only when the user explicitly wants to modify one existing Tradebee record and both the Tradebee object type and target record are already explicit.
- Prefer `*-delete` only when the user explicitly wants to delete Tradebee content and both the Tradebee object type and target record ID or confirmed ID list are already explicit.
- If the user mentions one exact ID, prefer the corresponding exact-ID read filter instead of a broader group filter.
- If the user mentions "under this group", "in this category", or "belonging to this group", prefer the corresponding group filter.
- If the request needs a language and the user has not provided one exact enabled code yet, call `languages-get` first.
- If the user gives both an exact ID and a group condition, prefer the exact ID if the API requires a mutually exclusive choice.
- If the user wants "details", "that one", or "the exact record", prefer the exact-ID filter over list-style filters.
- If the user wants "all", "recent", or "latest list", avoid adding unnecessary exact-ID filters.
- If the user asks for a business result but does not name the object type clearly, infer the object from nouns:
  `product` -> `products-*`, `product group/category` -> `productsgroup-*`, `blog/article` -> `blog-*`, `blog group/category` -> `bloggroup-*`, `faq` -> `faq-*`, `faq group/category` -> `faqgroup-*`, `custom page` -> `custompage-*`.

## Preview URL Rule

For these read actions:

- `blog-read`
- `bloggroup-read`
- `faq-read`
- `faqgroup-read`
- `custompage-read`
- `products-read`
- `productsgroup-read`

when the returned result is a list, the agent must include one ID and one preview URL in the final answer so the user can decide whether to preview it.

- Do not tell the user they must preview it.
- Do not omit the preview URL when the API response already contains the corresponding URL field.
- Do not omit the ID when the API response already contains the corresponding ID field.
- If `fields` is used, include the corresponding URL field so one preview URL is available in the returned list:
  `blog_url`, `bloggroup_url`, `faq_url`, `faqgroup_url`, `custompage_url`, `products_url`, or `productsgroup_url`.
  Also include the corresponding ID field:
  `blog_id`, `bloggroup_id`, `faq_id`, `faqgroup_id`, `custompage_id`, `products_id`, or `productsgroup_id`.

## Routing by Expected Result

Use this section when a request is phrased around a business outcome instead of an API term.

- "I want to know what product data exists"
  Use `products-read`.
- "I want one exact product"
  Use `products-read` with `products_id`.
- "I want products inside one category"
  Use `products-read` with `productsgroup_id`.
- "I want all top-level product categories"
  Use `productsgroup-read` with no filter or `parent_productsgroup_id=0`.
- "I want subcategories under one parent category"
  Use `productsgroup-read` with `parent_productsgroup_id`.
- "I want one exact product category"
  Use `productsgroup-read` with `productsgroup_id`.
- "I want blog articles"
  Use `blog-read`.
- "I want one exact blog"
  Use `blog-read` with `blog_id`.
- "I want blogs inside one blog group"
  Use `blog-read` with `bloggroup_id`.
- "I want all blog groups or one exact blog group"
  Use `bloggroup-read`, optionally with `bloggroup_id`.
- "I want FAQs"
  Use `faq-read`.
- "I want one exact FAQ"
  Use `faq-read` with `faq_id`.
- "I want FAQs inside one FAQ group"
  Use `faq-read` with `faqgroup_id`.
- "I want all FAQ groups or one exact FAQ group"
  Use `faqgroup-read`, optionally with `faqgroup_id`.
- "I want custom pages"
  Use `custompage-read`.
- "I want one exact custom page"
  Use `custompage-read` with `custompage_id`.
- "I want inquiry records from recent days"
  Use `inquiry-read`, optionally with `recent_days`.
- "I want recent visitor data"
  Use `visitor-recent`.
- "I want visitor data for one IP"
  Use `visitor-recent` with `ip`.
- "I want keyword ranking for one keyword"
  Use `keywords-rank` with `keywords`.
- "I want keywords ranking within the top N"
  Use `keywords-rank` with `rank`.

## Filter Selection Rules

When multiple filters exist, choose the one that most directly matches the user's wording.

- `products-read`
  If the user names one exact product, use `products_id`.
  If the user asks for products under one group, use `productsgroup_id`.
  Do not send both together.
- `productsgroup-read`
  If the user asks for one exact group, use `productsgroup_id`.
  If the user asks for children under a parent, use `parent_productsgroup_id`.
  If the user asks for top-level groups, omit both or use `parent_productsgroup_id=0`.
- `blog-read`
  If the user names one exact blog, use `blog_id`.
  If the user asks for blogs under one group, use `bloggroup_id`.
  Do not send both together.
- `bloggroup-read`
  If the user asks for one exact blog group, use `bloggroup_id`.
  Otherwise omit it to read the list.
- `faq-read`
  If the user names one exact FAQ, use `faq_id`.
  If the user asks for FAQs under one group, use `faqgroup_id`.
  Do not send both together.
- `faqgroup-read`
  If the user asks for one exact FAQ group, use `faqgroup_id`.
  Otherwise omit it to read the list.
- `custompage-read`
  If the user asks for one exact custom page, use `custompage_id`.
  Otherwise omit it to read the list.
- `visitor-recent`
  If the user gives one IP, use `ip`.
  Otherwise omit it to read recent visitors across all IPs.
- `keywords-rank`
  If the user gives one exact keyword text, use `keywords`.
  If the user asks for "top N", use `rank`.
  Do not send both together.

## Required Parameters

Authentication uses only the configured `BEE_API_KEY` environment variable. Never provide API keys in tool inputs, prompts, examples, logs, or chat text. Tradebee requests send site and business data to the external Tradebee Website Builder API, so only send the minimum data needed for the user's stated task.

### `action` (string)

Selects which capability to execute.

Practical routing rule:

- explicit Tradebee read or analysis request with a clear object type -> usually choose a `*-read` action
- explicit Tradebee create or publish request with a clear object type -> usually choose a `*-create` action
- explicit Tradebee update request for one known record -> usually choose a `*-update` action
- explicit Tradebee delete request for one known record or one confirmed ID list -> usually choose a `*-delete` action

Inline `style="..."` attributes and external stylesheet links are forbidden. Do not include `<h1>`; `<h2>`–`<h6>` are preferred. It supports up to 50 HTTP(S)-URL or `data:image/...;base64,...` images of at most 500 kB each. The 100,000-character limit is calculated after removing `<img>` tags; the server uploads base64 images and replaces their `src` values with URLs. For update, an empty string or omitted field leaves the current content unchanged.
- `navigation.open_in_new_window`: defaults to `false` on create. `true` opens in a new window or tab; `false` opens in the current one. For update, omit it to keep the current setting.
- `navigation.sort`: defaults to `999999` on create and must be 1–999999; smaller values appear earlier. For update, omit it to keep the current sort.
- Child modes are mutually exclusive: system children use type 1-7 and empty content; custom HTML uses type 0 and non-empty content; manual second-level children require type 0 and empty content.
- `navigation-read`: requires exact `language`; optionally use positive `navigation_id` for one item or `parent_navigation_id` (`0` for first level) for one level, but never both. Optional `fields` selects from `navigation_id`, `parent_navigation_id`, `language`, `name`, `url`, `system_children_type`, `content`, `open_in_new_window`, `sort`, `create_time`, `update_time`, `is_leaf`, and `children`. It does not use pagination.

### `id_list` (array)

Used by `blog-delete`, `bloggroup-delete`, `custompage-delete`, `faq-delete`, `faqgroup-delete`, `news-delete`, `newsgroup-delete`, `navigation-delete`, `productsgroup-delete`, and `products-delete`.

### `confirmation` (object)

Required by every create, update, and delete action, including news, news-group, and navigation mutations.

Before any create, update, or delete action, show the user the language and the exact payload or product IDs to be changed, then set:

```json
{
  "approved": true,
  "summary": "Confirmed by user: update product 123 in language en with the shown payload."
}
```

For every `*_update` action, this skill also enforces a pre-update backup capture and file persistence step.

- The current record must be read successfully before the update request is sent.
- The backup must be written to a local JSON file under `backups/<action>/` relative to the current installed skill root.
- That local JSON file persists `confirmation_summary`, `raw_read_response`, `snapshot`, `requested_update_payload`, `restore_payload`, and `restore_limitations`.
- That local backup file may contain sensitive business or personal data copied from the current record and requested update payload, so the user must be aware of and approve that local persistence before the update runs.
- If backup capture fails, or if the backup file cannot be written, the update must not run.
- If the update succeeds, the response includes `backup.storage.file_path`, `backup.raw_read_response`, `backup.snapshot`, and a best-effort `backup.restore_payload`.
- If the user later says the edit result is wrong, reuse that `backup.restore_payload` with the same `*_update` action to restore the previous state.
- Uploaded images are only partially restorable because the read APIs do not return the original image base64 content.

Common user intents:

- "Create a product"

### `products-update`

Updates an existing product under the selected language.

This action must not run unless the user has explicitly confirmed the language, target product ID, and exact payload to be changed.

Update rules:

- `products.products_id` is required
- Any field other than `products_id` should be omitted unless the user explicitly wants to change it
- Omitting a field means keep the existing value
- Do not move the product group unless the user explicitly asks for that change
- Capture a pre-update backup snapshot first; if backup capture fails, abort the update
- Return `backup.restore_payload` on success so the same product can be restored later if needed

Common user intents:

- "Update product 123"
- "Edit product information"

### `products-delete`

Moves one or more products to the recycle bin.

This action must not run unless the user has explicitly confirmed the language and exact product IDs to be moved to the recycle bin.

Common user intents:

- "Delete these products"
- "Move product 123 to recycle bin"

### `inquiry-read`

Returns inquiry records with optional language, recent-day filtering, and pagination.

Common user intents:

- "Read inquiries"
- "Show recent leads"
- "List inquiry records"

### `visitor-recent`

Returns recent visitor analytics with optional exact IP filtering and pagination.

Common user intents:

- "Show latest visitor behavior"

### `keywords-rank`

Returns keyword ranking records with optional exact keyword filtering, optional top-N rank filtering, pagination, latest rank values, and rank history.

Common user intents:

- "Check keyword ranking"
- "Find one keyword ranking"
- "Show keywords ranked within top 100"

## Extension Rule

When adding a new Tradebee capability in the future:

1. Add or update the underlying implementation module.
2. Register the new action in the root `index.js` action router.
3. Add the new action to the root `skill.json` input schema.
4. Document the new action here in the root `SKILL.md`.

Changes are not complete unless the unified `tradebee` entrypoint supports the new capability end to end.

## Example

```json
{
  "action": "products-read",
  "language": "en",
  "products_id": 12345,
  "pagination": {
    "current_page": 1,
    "page_size": 5
  }
}
```

## Decision Examples

```text
User: "Help me check the product categories"
Choose: productsgroup-read
Reason: the user wants product category data, not product data
```

```text
User: "Show what products are under this category"
Choose: products-read + productsgroup_id
Reason: the user wants product records under one group
```

```text
User: "Help me find product 12345"
Choose: products-read + products_id
Reason: the user wants one exact product
```

```text
User: "Show recent visits and filter this IP"
Choose: visitor-recent + ip
Reason: this is visitor analytics, not inquiry or product content
```

```text
User: "Check the top 100 keywords"
Choose: keywords-rank + rank=100
Reason: the user wants a top-N ranking slice, not one exact keyword
```
