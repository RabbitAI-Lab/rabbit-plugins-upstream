## Description:

Helps developers discover received public libraries and run bounded, caller-supplied checks for integration repair, tool input compatibility, and task distribution without sending payment.

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

## Publisher:

[epistemedeus](https://clawhub.ai/user/epistemedeus)

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT

## Use Case:

Developers and engineers use this skill to discover and run received library contracts or their own task inputs, check compatibility and repair classifications, and share bounded task referrals. A successful check does not by itself establish real-world usefulness or payment eligibility.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Fetched third-party packages and their CLIs execute in a caller-chosen directory.

Mitigation: Review pinned sources, use a disposable work directory, and run only if Node, tar, npm, and the listed public downloads are acceptable.

Risk: Caller-mode requests can contain sensitive task inputs or authorize unwanted local work.

Mitigation: Review requests before execution and keep credentials out of request files.

Risk: A matched description or successful contract replay can be mistaken for a completed real-world task.

Mitigation: Verify the caller's actual output and record usefulness separately; do not interpret a classification as a payment demand.
