# Auction research

Search Bonhams' public auction and lot catalog as normalized JSON for sale
calendar research, lot comparisons, estimates, and realized prices.

## When to use this skill

- Find upcoming or past Bonhams auctions.
- Search lots across auctions by object, artist, or category.
- Inspect one auction's metadata and lot list.
- Pull one lot's estimate, realized price, department, and sale facts.

## Setup

- Get a Crawlora API key at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=crawlora-skills).
- `export CRAWLORA_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here`
- Requests use `x-api-key: $CRAWLORA_API_KEY` against `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`.

## How it works

Use `/bonhams/auctions/search` for sale discovery and
`/bonhams/lots/search` for cross-sale lot research. Follow an auction id into
`/bonhams/auctions/{id}` and `/bonhams/auctions/{id}/lots`; use
`/bonhams/lots/{auctionId}/{lotNumber}` for full lot detail.
