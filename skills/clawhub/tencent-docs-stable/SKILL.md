# Tencent Docs Stable Channel

Purpose: make Tencent Docs writes survive connector failures. The MCP connector is the primary path; this skill defines a deterministic self-check sequence and a direct JSON-RPC fallback so a broken connector does not kill the task.

## Workflow

1. [Deterministic] **Classify the failure** from the error message: `no_token` / auth error / timeout / validation error / rate limit. Each class has a different remediation (see Failure Handling).
2. [Deterministic] **Token self-check**: resolve credentials the way the connector documents them (config file, environment variable, or connector-managed store). Verify the source exists and is non-empty. Never print the token value.
3. [Deterministic] **Retry once** after ~5 seconds with the identical call. Gateway blips are the most common transient cause; one retry resolves most of them.
4. [LLM] **Direct JSON-RPC fallback** (only if the connector still fails after one retry):
   - Read the MCP server configuration at runtime to discover the gateway endpoint. Never hardcode host, port, or token in scripts or skill text.
   - Send JSON-RPC requests over HTTP: method = tool name, params = tool arguments, same schema the connector uses.
   - For content above ~16KB, split at paragraph boundaries into chunks of ≤16KB and append sequentially (create document → append chunk 1 → append chunk 2 → ...). Appending whole documents in one call silently truncates or fails validation.
5. [Deterministic] **Verify**: read back the document title and first paragraph; confirm appended chunk count equals the number sent. Report the document link.

## Hard Rules

- Never print, log, or embed the token value anywhere.
- Never hardcode gateway endpoint, port, or credentials — always resolve from config at runtime.
- Exactly one retry before switching to fallback. No retry loops.
- Chunk size ≤16KB, split at paragraph boundaries, never mid-paragraph.
- After fallback, always verify by reading back, not by trusting the write response alone.

## Failure Handling

- `no_token` after self-check: report which credential source was checked and what was missing; stop. Do not invent a token.
- Both connector and fallback fail (one attempt each): mark the target UNREACHABLE with both error messages as evidence; do not keep polling.
- Validation error on content: check for unsupported HTML constructs (tables, nested lists, images with external hosts); degrade to plain paragraphs and retry once.
- Rate limit: wait 60s, retry once, then stop.

## Output Format

Short report: failure class → remediation used (retry / fallback) → verification result (title, paragraph count, chunk count) → document link.
