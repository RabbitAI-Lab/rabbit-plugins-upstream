description: >
  Use this skill whenever the user needs to operate a Kubernetes cluster — list/inspect pods, deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets, replicasets, jobs, cronjobs, services, ingresses, endpoints, configmaps, secrets (names/keys only), PVCs/PVs/storageclasses, nodes, namespaces, and events; read pod logs; describe pods/nodes; pod/node top (metrics); read-only diagnostics / RCA (pod-health, workload-readiness); scale deployments/statefulsets; rollout status/history/undo/pause/resume and set image; delete pods/deployments/jobs; create/delete namespaces; and cordon/uncordon/drain nodes. Works with any kubeconfig-reachable cluster (standard Kubernetes, k3s, EKS, GKE, AKS).
  Always use this skill for "list k8s pods", "scale deployment", "kubernetes pod logs", "describe pod", "why is my pod crashing", "diagnose pods", "which deployments are unhealthy", "rollout undo", "set image", "top pods", "drain node", "cordon node", "restart deployment", "k3s", or "kubectl"-style tasks when the context is explicitly Kubernetes / a cluster.
  Do NOT use when the target is not a Kubernetes cluster (hypervisor VM lifecycle, backup products, or cloud-provider consoles are out of scope).
  Common Kubernetes operations with a built-in governance harness (audit, token budget, undo, risk-tier labels).

compatibility: >
  Standalone, self-governed Kubernetes operations. The governance harness (audit, token/runaway budget, undo, risk-tier labels) is bundled in the package — no external skill-family dependency.
  All write operations are audited to a local SQLite DB under ~/.k8s-aiops/ (relocatable via K8S_AIOPS_HOME).
  Credentials: k8s-aiops handles NO credentials directly — authentication is delegated to the kubeconfig (KUBECONFIG env or ~/.kube/config), which may hold client certs, bearer tokens, or exec plugins (EKS/GKE/AKS). Underlying credentials are never read, logged, or echoed. The state dir ~/.k8s-aiops should be chmod 700.
  Destructive operations (deployment/job/namespace delete, node cordon/drain, rollout undo) require double confirmation at the CLI layer and support --dry-run. All write tools pass through the @governed_tool decorator (budget/runaway guard + audit + a descriptive risk-tier label). Reversible writes record an inverse undo descriptor (scale_deployment/scale_statefulset restore the previous replica count; set_deployment_image restores the previous image; cordon_node ↔ uncordon_node and rollout_pause ↔ rollout_resume; create_namespace ↔ delete_namespace); delete_* and rollout_undo record none. risk_level=high: delete_deployment, delete_job, delete_namespace, drain_node, rollout_undo_deployment. Secret VALUES are never read or returned by any tool.
  Webhooks: none — no outbound network calls beyond the configured Kubernetes API server.
  TLS: follows the kubeconfig (certificate-authority / insecure-skip-tls-verify); the skill does not weaken it.
  Transitive dependencies: the official kubernetes Python client and the MCP SDK. No post-install scripts or background services.

Governed Kubernetes operations — **55 MCP tools**, every one wrapped with the bundled `@governed_tool` harness: a local unified audit log under `~/.k8s-aiops/`, a token/runaway budget guard, undo-token recording, and a descriptive risk-tier label on every audit row. Works with any kubeconfig-reachable cluster (standard Kubernetes, k3s, EKS, GKE, AKS). Run `k8s-aiops init` for a friendly onboarding wizard that registers your kube contexts as named targets.

> **Standalone**: the governance harness is bundled in the package (`k8s_aiops.governance`) — k8s-aiops has no external skill-family dependency. Coverage focuses on common operations and is not yet exhaustive.

## Quick Install

```bash
uv tool install k8s-aiops
k8s-aiops init            # friendly wizard: register your kube contexts as targets
k8s-aiops doctor          # or skip init — works with your current kube-context too
```

## When to Use This Skill

- List/inspect pods, deployments, services, nodes, namespaces and recent events
- Read a pod's recent log lines to diagnose a crash loop
- Run a read-only RCA sweep (`diagnose pod-health` / `diagnose workload-readiness`) to find the root cause worst-first
- Scale a deployment up/down, or trigger a rolling restart
- Delete a stuck pod (a controller recreates it) or a deployment
- Cordon a node before maintenance, then uncordon it after

**Do NOT use when** the target is not a Kubernetes cluster (hypervisor VM lifecycle, backup products, or cloud-provider consoles are out of scope for this skill).

## Related Skills — Skill Routing

| If the user wants… | Use |
|--------------------|-----|
| Kubernetes pods / deployments / nodes | **k8s-aiops** (this skill) |
| Hypervisor VM lifecycle (power, snapshot, migrate) | a hypervisor ops skill |
| Backup & restore | a backup ops skill |

## Common Workflows

### Diagnose a crash-looping pod and restart its deployment

1. `k8s-aiops pod list -n prod` → find the pod with high `restarts` / non-Running `phase`
2. `k8s-aiops pod logs <pod> -n prod --tail 200` → read the recent logs for the crash cause
3. `k8s-aiops events -n prod` → check for `FailedScheduling` / image-pull events
4. `k8s-aiops deployment restart <deploy> -n prod` → roll the deployment after fixing the cause
5. **Failure branch**: if logs/events show an RBAC `403`, the kube context lacks the verb — run `kubectl auth can-i get pods -n prod` and switch to a context with adequate RBAC; the skill never retries a denied auth.

### Triage an unhealthy namespace with RCA, then act on the worst finding

1. `k8s-aiops diagnose pod-health -n prod` → worst-first findings; a `critical` `CrashLoopBackOff` on `prod/api` cites `restarts=9` and the exact `kubectl logs … --previous` action
2. `k8s-aiops diagnose workload-readiness -n prod` → confirm the blast radius: e.g. `Deployment web ready 0/3` (`critical`, under-replicated)
3. `k8s-aiops pod logs api-<hash> -n prod --tail 200 --previous`-equivalent via `k8s-aiops pod describe api-<hash> -n prod` → read the crash cause the RCA pointed you at
4. `k8s-aiops deployment restart web -n prod` → roll the deployment once the root cause is fixed
5. **Failure branch**: if `diagnose` returns an RBAC `403`, the kube context cannot list pods/deployments in that namespace — run `kubectl auth can-i list pods -n prod` and switch to a context with adequate RBAC; the RCA tools are read-only and never retry a denied auth.

### Drain a node for maintenance, safely reversible

1. `k8s-aiops node list` → identify the node and confirm it is `Ready`/schedulable
2. `k8s-aiops node cordon <node> --dry-run` → preview, then `k8s-aiops node cordon <node>` (double confirm) — records an inverse `uncordon_node` undo descriptor
3. After maintenance: `k8s-aiops node uncordon <node>` → re-enable scheduling
4. **Failure branch**: if `doctor` shows the cluster unreachable, fix the kubeconfig context (`kubectl config get-contexts`) before retrying — cordon is never issued against an unauthenticated session.

## Usage Mode

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|:-----------:|-----|
| Local/small models | **CLI** | fewer tokens than MCP |
| Cloud models (Claude, GPT) | Either | MCP gives structured JSON I/O |
| Automated pipelines | **MCP** | type-safe parameters, audited |

> **MCP environment caveat**: MCP clients spawn the server with a CLEAN
> environment — shell exports may not reach it. Set `K8S_AIOPS_HOME`,
> `K8S_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY`, `K8S_AUDIT_RATIONALE` (and `KUBECONFIG` when the
> kubeconfig is not at `~/.kube/config`) in the MCP server config's `env`
> block, not just in your terminal.

## MCP Tools (55 — 39 read, 16 write)

| Category | Tools | R/W |
|----------|-------|:---:|
| Pods | `pod_list`, `pod_get`, `pod_logs`, `pod_describe` | Read |
| | `delete_pod` | Write |
| Deployments | `deployment_list`, `deployment_get` | Read |
| | `scale_deployment`, `rollout_restart_deployment`, `delete_deployment` | Write |
| Rollout | `rollout_status`, `rollout_history` | Read |
| | `rollout_undo_deployment`, `rollout_pause`, `rollout_resume`, `set_deployment_image` | Write |
| StatefulSets | `statefulset_list`, `statefulset_get` | Read |
| | `scale_statefulset` | Write |
| DaemonSets / ReplicaSets | `daemonset_list`, `daemonset_get`, `replicaset_list` | Read |
| Jobs / CronJobs | `job_list`, `job_get`, `cronjob_list`, `cronjob_get` | Read |
| | `delete_job` | Write |
| Services / Ingress | `service_list`, `ingress_list`, `ingress_get`, `endpoints_list` | Read |
| Config / Secrets | `configmap_list`, `configmap_get`, `secret_list` (names/keys only) | Read |
| Storage | `pvc_list`, `pvc_get`, `pv_list`, `storageclass_list` | Read |
| Nodes | `node_list`, `node_describe` | Read |
| | `cordon_node`, `uncordon_node`, `drain_node` | Write |
| Namespaces | `namespace_list` | Read |
| | `create_namespace`, `delete_namespace` | Write |
| Metrics (top) | `node_top`, `pod_top` | Read |
| Cluster | `cluster_info`, `api_resources` | Read |
| Events | `event_list` | Read |
| Diagnostics / RCA | `pod_health_rca`, `workload_readiness_rca` | Read |
| Undo | `undo_list` | Read |
| | `undo_apply` | Write |

**Security — secrets**: `secret_list` returns secret names, types, and key NAMES only. Secret VALUES are never read, returned, or logged, and there is deliberately no tool that returns secret values.

**Dry-run previews**: every write tool takes `dry_run: bool = False`. A dry run returns a `{"dryRun": true, "wouldX": ...}` preview without touching the cluster, and no undo descriptor is recorded for a preview.

**Harness features that light up**: write tools with a clean inverse pass an `undo=` lambda so the harness records an inverse descriptor (with `_undo_id`) to the undo store — `scale_deployment`/`scale_statefulset` record a scale-back to their returned `previous_replicas`, `set_deployment_image` records a restore to the captured `previous_image`, `cordon_node` ↔ `uncordon_node` and `rollout_pause` ↔ `rollout_resume` are mutual inverses, and `create_namespace` records a `delete_namespace`. `drain_node` records a partial `uncordon_node` inverse (cordon is reversible; evictions are not). `delete_*` and `rollout_undo_deployment` declare no undo. `risk_level=high`: `delete_deployment`, `delete_job`, `delete_namespace`, `drain_node`, `rollout_undo_deployment`. `undo_list` (read) lists recorded reversible writes whose undo tokens have not been applied yet, and `undo_apply` (write) executes a recorded inverse — itself governed, single-use, and supports `dry_run`. All 55 tools are audit-logged under `~/.k8s-aiops/` and pass through the budget/runaway guard, each recorded with a descriptive risk-tier label. `pod_top`/`node_top` return a clear "metrics-server not installed" message (not an error) when metrics-server is absent. Avoid tight poll loops (re-listing pods every second) — the runaway breaker backs this up.

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not load kubeconfig … context not found"
The named context does not exist in your kubeconfig. Run `kubectl config get-contexts` and set the target's `context:` to a listed name (or omit it to use current-context).

### "Authentication/authorization failed (401/403)"
The kube context lacks the RBAC verb for the resource. Check with `kubectl auth can-i <verb> <resource> -n <ns>` and switch to a context/ServiceAccount with adequate roles. For EKS/GKE/AKS, confirm the exec-plugin (aws/gcloud/az CLI) is installed and logged in.

### "Resource not found (404)"
The pod/deployment/node name or namespace is wrong, or the object was deleted. List the parent collection first (`pod list`, `deployment list`, `node list`) to get a current name. Remember most commands default to the `default` namespace unless `-n` is given.

### "Conflict (409)"
The object changed concurrently (or already exists). Re-read it and retry the write.

### Logs are empty or truncated
`pod logs` returns the trailing `--tail` lines (default 100); raise `--tail`. For a multi-container pod, pass `-c <container>` or the API returns an error naming the available containers.

## Audit & Safety

All operations are automatically audited via the bundled `@governed_tool` decorator (`k8s_aiops.governance`):
- Every tool call logged to `~/.k8s-aiops/audit.db` (local SQLite audit DB; relocate with `K8S_AIOPS_HOME`)
- Budget / runaway guard caps cumulative tool calls and wall-time, and trips on tight poll/retry loops — a safety backstop, not authorization
- Undo store records inverse descriptors for reversible writes (scale → previous replicas; cordon ↔ uncordon)
- Each write carries a descriptive risk-tier label into its audit row — a label, not a gate; `K8S_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY` / `K8S_AUDIT_RATIONALE` are optional annotations recorded when set, never required

**Authorization is not this tool's job.** There is no read-only switch, policy file, or approval gate. Whether a write is permitted is the agent's judgement or the RBAC of the kubeconfig context you connect with — give it a read-only ServiceAccount and writes fail at the apiserver, the place that owns the permission.

The harness is bundled in the package — no external dependency, no manual setup. See `references/setup-guide.md` for security details.
