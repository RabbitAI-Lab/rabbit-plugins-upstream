description: >
  Use this skill whenever the user needs to operate Veeam Backup & Replication — a one-shot health overview, read-only diagnostics / RCA (triage failed backup-job sessions and flag repositories low on space), list/inspect/start/stop/retry backup jobs, enable/disable jobs, list restore points and start a VM restore, list backup repositories with capacity, list stored backups and their objects, inventory backup infrastructure (managed servers, proxies), and poll/stop async sessions for job/restore progress.
  Always use this skill for "list veeam jobs", "run veeam backup", "start veeam job", "veeam restore", "veeam repository", "veeam backup status", or "veeam session" when the context is explicitly Veeam / Veeam Backup & Replication / VBR.
  Do NOT use when the target is not Veeam Backup & Replication (other backup products, hypervisor lifecycle, or cloud providers are out of scope).
  Common Veeam B&R operations with a built-in governance harness (audit, policy, token budget, undo, risk-tiers).

compatibility: >
  Standalone, self-governed Veeam Backup & Replication operations. The governance harness (audit, policy, token/runaway budget, undo, risk-tiers) is bundled in the package — no external skill-family dependency.
  All write operations are audited to a local SQLite DB under ~/.veeam-aiops/ (relocatable via VEEAM_AIOPS_HOME).
  Credentials: Each Veeam target's login password is stored ENCRYPTED in ~/.veeam-aiops/secrets.enc (Fernet/AES-128 + scrypt-derived key) — never plaintext on disk. Run 'veeam-aiops init' to onboard, or 'veeam-aiops secret set <target>' to add one. The store is unlocked by a master password from VEEAM_AIOPS_MASTER_PASSWORD (non-interactive/MCP/CI) or an interactive prompt (CLI on a TTY). A legacy plaintext env var VEEAM_<TARGET_NAME_UPPER>_PASSWORD is still honoured as a fallback with a deprecation warning (migrate with 'veeam-aiops secret migrate'). The password is exchanged for a short-lived OAuth2 bearer token at connect time and held only in memory; passwords/tokens are never logged or echoed.
  Destructive operations (job stop, session stop, restore start) require double confirmation at the CLI layer and support --dry-run. A dry_run MAY read (that is how it can tell you the call would be refused) but never writes, records no undo, and is audited like any other governed call; the CLI --dry-run routes through the same governed function as the MCP tool. All write tools pass through the @governed_tool decorator (budget guard + audit + risk-tier labelling). Reversible writes (job start/stop/retry, enable/disable) record an inverse undo descriptor; session stop and the VM restore are irreversible and record none.
  Webhooks: none — no outbound network calls beyond the configured Veeam REST API endpoint.
  SSL: verify_ssl defaults to true; disable only for self-signed lab certificates.
  Transitive dependencies: httpx (HTTP client) and the MCP SDK. No post-install scripts or background services.

Governed Veeam Backup & Replication operations — **25 MCP tools**, every one wrapped with the bundled `@governed_tool` harness: a local unified audit log under `~/.veeam-aiops/`, policy engine, token/runaway budget guard, undo-token recording, and descriptive risk tiers. Credentials are stored **encrypted** (`~/.veeam-aiops/secrets.enc`, Fernet + scrypt) — never plaintext on disk.

> **Standalone**: the governance harness is bundled in the package (`veeam_aiops.governance`) — veeam-aiops has no external skill-family dependency. Coverage focuses on common Veeam operations and is not yet exhaustive.

## When to Use This Skill

- List/inspect Veeam backup jobs and their last result
- Start or stop a backup job on demand
- Enable or disable a job's schedule
- List available restore points and start a VM restore
- List backup repositories and stored backups
- Poll async sessions to follow job/restore progress

**Do NOT use when** the target is not Veeam Backup & Replication (other backup products, hypervisor VM lifecycle, Kubernetes, or cloud providers are out of scope for this skill).

## Common Workflows

### Diagnose why last night's backups failed

1. `veeam-aiops diagnose job-failures` → worst-first table of Failed/Warning sessions, each with the categorized cause (repository full / source unreachable / credential-VSS / retry exhaustion) and the cited failing log line
2. If a finding says **repository full**, confirm with `veeam-aiops diagnose repo-capacity` → the flagged repo's measured free% and free bytes
3. Fix the root cause (extend/offload the repository, restore source connectivity, or repair guest credentials/VSS), then `veeam-aiops job retry <job_id>` to re-run only the failed objects
4. `veeam-aiops session list` → `veeam-aiops session get <session_id>` to confirm the retry completes — do not tight-loop `session get` (the runaway budget guard will trip it)

### Run a backup job and follow it to completion

1. `veeam-aiops job list` → find the job id and confirm `lastResult`
2. `veeam-aiops job start <job_id>` → starts the job (records an inverse `job_stop` undo descriptor)
3. `veeam-aiops session list` → find the running session; `veeam-aiops session get <session_id>` → check `state` / `progressPercent`
4. **Failure branch**: if `session get` shows the session `Failed`, inspect `result`, then re-run `job start` after fixing the cause — do not loop `session get` rapidly (the runaway budget guard will trip a tight poll loop).

### Restore a VM from a restore point

1. `veeam-aiops restore list-points` → identify the correct restore point id
2. `veeam-aiops restore start --restore-point-id <id> --dry-run` → preview the exact API call **and the VM name + creation time** the id resolves to — never approve a restore from a GUID
3. `veeam-aiops restore start --restore-point-id <id>` → double confirmation required; this is IRREVERSIBLE (overwrites/creates a VM) and records no undo token. Refused outright if the VM name matches the configured VBR host (an in-place overwrite of the backup server itself) — a name-based safety net, not a proof, so confirm the target yourself
4. **Failure branch**: if `doctor` shows the VBR server unreachable or the password env var is missing, fix `~/.veeam-aiops/.env` (chmod 600) before retrying — the restore is never issued against an unauthenticated session.

## Usage Mode

| Scenario | Recommended | Why |
|----------|:-----------:|-----|
| Local/small models | **CLI** | fewer tokens than MCP |
| Cloud models (Claude, GPT) | Either | MCP gives structured JSON I/O |
| Automated pipelines | **MCP** | type-safe parameters, audited |

## MCP Tools (25 — 17 read, 8 write)

| Category | Tools | R/W |
|----------|-------|:---:|
| Overview | `overview` | Read |
| Diagnostics / RCA | `job_failure_rca`, `repository_capacity_rca` | Read |
| Backup Jobs | `job_list`, `job_get` | Read |
| | `job_start`, `job_stop`, `job_retry`, `job_enable`, `job_disable` | Write |
| Restore | `restore_list_points` | Read |
| | `start_vm_restore` | Write |
| Repositories | `repository_list`, `repository_get`, `repository_state` | Read |
| Backups | `backup_list`, `backup_object_list` | Read |
| Infrastructure | `managed_server_list`, `proxy_list` | Read |
| Sessions | `session_list`, `session_get`, `session_log` | Read |
| | `session_stop` | Write |
| Undo | `undo_list` | Read |
| | `undo_apply` | Write |

**Harness features that light up**: write tools with a clean inverse (`job_start`↔`job_stop`, `job_retry`→`job_stop`, `job_enable`↔`job_disable`) pass an `undo=` lambda so the harness records an inverse descriptor (with `_undo_id`) to the undo store. The irreversible `start_vm_restore` and `session_stop` declare no undo; `start_vm_restore` is tagged `risk_level=high`. All 25 tools are audit-logged under `~/.veeam-aiops/` and pass through the budget/runaway guard, each row carrying a descriptive risk tier. Veeam jobs/restores run as async sessions — poll with `session_get` / `session_log` instead of re-issuing (the runaway breaker backs this up). Start any triage with `overview` (jobs by last result, repos near full, running sessions), then drill in with `job_failure_rca` (categorizes failing sessions with cited error substrings) and `repository_capacity_rca` (cited free%).

## Troubleshooting

### "Config file not found"
Run `veeam-aiops init` to set up your first target (writes `~/.veeam-aiops/config.yaml` and stores the password encrypted).

### "No password for target '<name>'"
Add it to the encrypted store: `veeam-aiops secret set <name>` (prompts hidden), or run `veeam-aiops init`. For non-interactive use (MCP/CI), also export `VEEAM_AIOPS_MASTER_PASSWORD` so the store can be unlocked without a prompt.

### "Master password not set" / "Wrong master password"
The encrypted store `~/.veeam-aiops/secrets.enc` is unlocked by `VEEAM_AIOPS_MASTER_PASSWORD` (or an interactive prompt). If you forgot it, delete `secrets.enc` and re-run `veeam-aiops init`. Rotate it with `veeam-aiops secret rotate-password`.

### "Authentication/authorization failed (401)"
The username/password is wrong, or the account lacks a Veeam role. Veeam usernames are typically `DOMAIN\\user` or a local Windows account on the VBR server. Confirm the account can log in to the Veeam console.

### "Could not reach Veeam server … check the host/port"
The default REST API port is 9419 — confirm the Veeam Backup & Replication REST API service is running and the port is open. For self-signed certificates set `verify_ssl: false` on the target (lab only).

### "Resource not found (404)"
The job/session/restore-point id is stale. List the parent collection first (`job list`, `session list`, `restore list-points`) to get a current id.

## Governance & Safety

The skill delivers reads and writes and records them; it does **not** decide
whether a write is permitted. That is your agent's judgement, or the permission
of the Veeam account you connect it with (a read-only or restricted role on the
VBR server — writes then fail at the server). There is no read-only switch,
policy file, or approval gate.

- Credentials stored **encrypted** in `~/.veeam-aiops/secrets.enc` (Fernet/AES-128 + scrypt key derivation; chmod 600) — never plaintext on disk; the master password is never stored, only a per-store salt + ciphertext
- **Audit is the guarantee, and it is not bypassable.** Every operation — MCP and CLI alike — is logged to `~/.veeam-aiops/audit.db` (relocatable via `VEEAM_AIOPS_HOME`): params (secrets redacted), result, status, duration, and the risk tier. The CLI writes the same row the MCP path does.
- `VEEAM_AUDIT_APPROVED_BY` / `VEEAM_AUDIT_RATIONALE` are optional annotations recorded on the audit row (who/why); they are never required and never block.
- **Runaway guard** — a safety backstop, not authorization: cumulative tool calls and wall-time are capped, and the same call looped in a tight session-poll/retry window trips a circuit breaker.
- Writes support `--dry-run` / `dry_run=True` and double confirmation at the CLI; CLI writes execute through the same governed tools, so they are audited + undo-recorded.
- Reversible writes (job start/stop/retry, enable/disable) record an inverse undo descriptor; the irreversible `start_vm_restore` and `session_stop` record none.

The harness is bundled in the package — no external dependency, no manual setup. See `references/setup-guide.md` for security details.
