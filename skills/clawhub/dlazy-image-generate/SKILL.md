# 图片生成 Image Generate

[English](./SKILL.md) · [中文](./SKILL-cn.md)









Image generation skill. Automatically selects the best dlazy CLI image model based on the prompt.

## Trigger Keywords

- generate image
- draw picture
- text to image

## Authentication

All requests require a dLazy API key. The recommended way to authenticate is `dlazy login`:

```bash
dlazy login
```

This runs a device-code flow (also works in remote shells) and **automatically saves your API key** to the local CLI config — no manual copy/paste required.

### Alternative: Set the Key Manually

If you already have an API key, you can save it directly:

```bash
dlazy auth set YOUR_API_KEY
```

The CLI saves the key in your user config directory (`~/.dlazy/config.json` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.dlazy\config.json` on Windows), with file permissions restricted to your OS user account. You can also supply the key per-invocation via the `DLAZY_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Getting Your API Key Manually

1. Sign in or create an account at [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com)
2. Go to [dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key](https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key)
3. Copy the key shown in the API Key section

Each key is scoped to your dLazy organization and can be **rotated or revoked at any time** from the same dashboard.




## About & Provenance

- **CLI source code**: [github.com/dlazyai/cli](https://github.com/dlazyai/cli)
- **Maintainer**: dlazyai
- **npm package**: `@dlazy/cli` (pinned to `1.2.3` in this skill's install spec)
- **Homepage**: [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com)

You can install on demand without persisting a global binary by running:

```bash
npx @dlazy/cli@1.2.3 <command>
```

Or, if you prefer a global install, the skill's `metadata.clawdbot.install` field declares the exact pinned version (`npm install -g @dlazy/cli@1.2.3`). Review the GitHub source before installing.

## How It Works

This skill is a thin client over the dLazy hosted API. When you invoke it:

- Prompts and parameters you provide are sent to the dLazy API endpoint (`api.dlazy.com`) for inference.
- Any local file paths you pass to image / video / audio fields are uploaded to dLazy's media storage (`files.dlazy.com`) so the model can read them — the same flow as any cloud-based generation API.
- Generated output URLs returned by the API are hosted on `files.dlazy.com`.

This is the standard SaaS pattern; the skill itself does not access network or filesystem resources beyond what the dLazy CLI already handles. See [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com) for the full service terms.

## Piping Between Commands

Every `dlazy` invocation prints a JSON envelope on stdout. Any flag value can be a **pipe reference** that pulls from the upstream command's envelope, so you can chain steps without copying URLs by hand.

| Reference          | Resolves to                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-`                | Upstream's natural value for this field (scalar or array)       |
| `@N`               | The N-th output's primary value (e.g. `@0` = first output url)  |
| `@N.<jsonpath>`    | Drill into the N-th output (`@0.url`, `@1.meta.fps`)            |
| `@*`               | All outputs' primary values as an array                         |
| `@stdin`           | The whole upstream JSON envelope                                |
| `@stdin:<jsonpath>` | Jsonpath into the whole envelope (`@stdin:result.outputs[0].url`) |

### Examples

```bash
# Generate an image and feed its url straight into image-to-video
dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "a red fox in snow" \
  | dlazy kling-v3 --image - --prompt "fox starts running"

# Generate an image, then add TTS narration over a still
dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "lighthouse at dawn" \
  | dlazy qwen-tts --text "Welcome to the coast." --image @0.url

# Fan-out: pass every upstream output url into a batch step
dlazy seedream-4.5 --prompt "city skyline" --n 4 \
  | dlazy superres --images @*
```

> Required flags can be entirely sourced from the pipe — `--field -` satisfies the requirement when an upstream value exists. If stdin is empty, the CLI fails with `code: "no_stdin"`.

## Usage

This skill handles all image generation requests by selecting the best `dlazy` image model.

### Available Image Models

- `dlazy banana-pro`: High-quality text-to-image model (optional 1 reference image). Good for detailed key visuals, product shots, and brand-style imagery.
- `dlazy banana2`: General text-to-image model (optional 1 reference image), prioritizing speed and cost. Good for quick drafts, social posts, and multi-ratio generation.
- `dlazy gpt-image-2`: GPT Image 2 model for text-to-image and image editing. Supports generating images from text as well as editing and synthesizing images with reference inputs.
- `dlazy image-replicate`: Image replicate tool: analyzes the source's composition, color, lighting, and style, then uses Seedream 4.5 to generate a new image in the same style.
- `dlazy imageseg`: Image matting tool: separates foreground and returns a transparent-background URL. Good for product images, cutouts, and compositing.
- `dlazy jimeng-t2i`: Jimeng high-res text-to-image model with multi-ratio ultra-HD output and reference-image constraints. Good for commercial visuals and refined output.

- `dlazy seedream-5.0-lite`: Lightweight high-speed image generation model, suitable for batch generation, sketches, and low-cost iteration. Supports prompt + reference images, outputting 2K/3K images.
- `dlazy seedream-5.0-pro`: Professional tier of Seedream 5.0, stronger on fine detail, typography and complex composition. Suited to commercial key visuals and demanding brand assets.
- `dlazy superres`: Image super-resolution tool: enhances image clarity and details, returning enhanced URL, suitable for low-res asset restoration and upscaling.
- `dlazy vectorize`: Image-to-SVG tool: converts raster images (PNG/JPG) into color vector SVG and returns the URL, suitable for lossless scaling and vectorization of logos, icons, and flat illustrations.
- `dlazy viduq2-t2i`: Vidu image model with text + reference image, ratio, and resolution control. Good for character art, covers, and high-res output.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AGENT**:

1. Select the most appropriate image model.
2. Run `dlazy <model_name> -h` to check parameters.
3. Execute the command.
