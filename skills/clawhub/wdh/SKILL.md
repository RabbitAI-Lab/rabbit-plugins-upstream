Use when the user wants any of these utilities and has an EVM wallet, or mentions x402, USDC, micropayment, pay-per-call, or any of the wdh.sh hostnames (files.wdh.sh, short.wdh.sh, charts.wdh.sh, md.wdh.sh, qr.wdh.sh, feedback.wdh.sh, support.wdh.sh). Costs $0.001–$5.00 USDC per call depending on tool.

# WDH.sh

A family of seven small, paid-per-call HTTP services for agents and humans.
One CLI wraps every endpoint and signs payments automatically using the
agent's wallet — no signups, no API keys, no subscriptions. Every call is
settled in USDC on Base mainnet via the [x402](https://x402.org) protocol.

## Prerequisites

- An EVM wallet with **USDC on Base mainnet** (`eip155:8453`). $1 of USDC
  covers thousands of calls except for `feedback` ($1) and `support` ($5).
- Private key exported as `WDH_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` (a hex string starting
  with `0x`).
- Node.js 20+ (the CLI ships as [`@wdhsh/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wdhsh/cli) on npm and runs anywhere Node runs).

The buyer never submits an on-chain transaction directly. The Coinbase
x402 facilitator handles settlement and pays gas. See
[https://x402.org](https://x402.org) for protocol detail.

## Services Overview

| Tool | Cost (USDC) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `files` | $0.001 – $0.10 (size-tiered) | Big-file transfer to a public expiring URL (≤5 GB, ≤7 days) |
| `short` | $0.001 | URL shortener — links never expire by default |
| `charts` | $0.005 | Chart rendering proxy (Chart.js payload → PNG) |
| `md` | $0.002 | Publish a markdown file as a hosted HTML page (≤30 days) |
| `qr` | $0.001 | QR code image (PNG or SVG) |
| `feedback` | $1.00 | Paid feature request — opens a Linear issue on the WDH team's tracker |
| `support` | $5.00 | Paid support ticket — opens a high-priority Linear issue |

## Install

The CLI is published as [`@wdhsh/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wdhsh/cli) on npm.
Use it via `bunx` or `npx` for zero-install, or install globally:

```bash
bunx @wdhsh/cli --help        # zero-install, one-shot
npm i -g @wdhsh/cli && wdh --help
```

```bash
export WDH_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

Once the env var is set, every command pays automatically. Without it the
CLI refuses to run.

## Commands

### `files upload` — Big-file transfer

Multipart upload to `files.wdh.sh`. Returns a public download URL.

```bash
bunx @wdhsh/cli files upload ./report.pdf --expires 7d
bunx @wdhsh/cli files upload ./build.tar.gz                   # 24h default TTL
```

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<path>` | yes | — | Path to the file to upload (up to 5 GB) |
| `--expires <ttl>` | no | `24h` | TTL like `30m`, `24h`, `7d`. Max 7 days |

Size-tiered pricing: $0.001 (≤10 MB), $0.005 (≤100 MB), $0.02 (≤500 MB),
$0.05 (≤2 GB), $0.10 (≤5 GB).

### `short create` — URL shortener

Returns a short `https://short.wdh.sh/<slug>` URL. **Links never expire by
default** — safe for business cards, printed materials, anywhere a permanent
redirect target is wanted.

```bash
bunx @wdhsh/cli short create https://example.com/very/long/path
bunx @wdhsh/cli short create https://example.com --slug launch
bunx @wdhsh/cli short create https://example.com --expires 30d
```

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<url>` | yes | — | URL to shorten (http or https only) |
| `--slug <s>` | no | auto-generated | Custom slug. Matches `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{3,32}$` |
| `--expires <ttl>` | no | never | TTL like `24h`, `30d`. Omit and the link persists indefinitely |

### `charts plot` — Chart.js rendering

Proxies a [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) payload to the chartsplat
renderer. Writes raw PNG bytes to stdout (or to `--out` if provided).

```bash
bunx @wdhsh/cli charts plot \
  --type bar \
  --data '{"labels":["Q1","Q2","Q3","Q4"],"datasets":[{"label":"Revenue","data":[50,75,60,90]}]}' \
  > chart.png
```

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--type <kind>` | yes | — | Chart.js chart type (`bar`, `line`, `pie`, `doughnut`, `radar`, etc.) |
| `--data <json>` | yes | — | Chart.js JSON payload as a string (parsed and forwarded as the request body) |

See [chartsplat docs](https://chartsplat.com/docs) for the full schema and
supported chart types.

### `md publish` — Hosted markdown pages

Publishes a local markdown file as a styled HTML page on `md.wdh.sh`.
Returns the public URL.

```bash
bunx @wdhsh/cli md publish ./notes.md
bunx @wdhsh/cli md publish ./post.md --title "Launch notes"
bunx @wdhsh/cli md publish ./scratch.md --expires 24h
```

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<file>` | yes | — | Path to a local markdown file (max 1 MB) |
| `--title <t>` | no | `Shared markdown` | Page title for the rendered HTML |
| `--expires <ttl>` | no | `7d` | TTL like `24h`, `7d`, `30d`. Max 30 days |

Renderer is `markdown-it` with HTML escaped and `javascript:` / `data:` /
`vbscript:` / `file:` links dropped.

### `qr generate` — QR code images

Renders a QR code as a PNG (default) or SVG.

```bash
bunx @wdhsh/cli qr generate "https://wdh.sh" --out wdh.png
bunx @wdhsh/cli qr generate "wifi:T:WPA;S:...;P:..." --size 1024 > wifi.png
bunx @wdhsh/cli qr generate "ping" --format svg > ping.svg
```

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<data>` | yes | — | Text or URL to encode (max 2048 chars) |
| `--size <px>` | no | `512` | Output size in pixels. Clamped to 64–2048 |
| `--format <png\|svg>` | no | `png` | Output format |
| `--out <file>` | no | stdout | Write the image to a file path instead |

### `feedback` — Paid feature requests

Files a $1.00 paid feature request as a Linear issue on the WDH team's
tracker. Returns the issue URL.

```bash
bunx @wdhsh/cli feedback "Add Solana support" --body "We'd use this for..."
echo "long-form body here" | bunx @wdhsh/cli feedback "Title goes here"
bunx @wdhsh/cli feedback "Bug in qr" --body "..." --contact me@example.com
```

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<title>` | yes | — | Issue title (max 200 chars) |
| `--body <text>` | no | from stdin | Issue body (max 10 000 chars). Omit to read from stdin |
| `--contact <email>` | no | — | Optional reply-to address |

### `support` — Paid support tickets

Files a $5.00 paid support ticket as a high-priority Linear issue.
Severity maps to Linear priority. `--contact` is required so the team can
follow up.

```bash
bunx @wdhsh/cli support "Files endpoint 500s" \
  --contact me@example.com \
  --body "every /init returns 500 since 14:00 UTC" \
  --severity high

cat incident.md | bunx @wdhsh/cli support "x402 settlement timing out" \
  --contact me@example.com --severity critical
```

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<title>` | yes | — | Ticket title (prefixed with `[support]`, max 200 chars) |
| `--contact <email>` | yes | — | Reply-to email |
| `--body <text>` | no | from stdin | Ticket body (max 10 000 chars). Omit to read from stdin |
| `--severity <lvl>` | no | `medium` | `low \| medium \| high \| critical` → Linear priority 4\|3\|2\|1 |

## Output Handling

- Most commands print a **single line to stdout**: the resulting URL
  (`files`, `short`, `md`, `feedback`, `support`) or the path that was
  written (`qr --out <file>`).
- `qr` (without `--out`) and `charts` write **raw image bytes** to stdout —
  always pipe to a file: `> chart.png`.

## Tips

- **Wallet hygiene.** Use a throwaway Base wallet for the agent — load it
  with the budget you're willing to spend and revoke by deleting the key.
- **Idempotency for `feedback` / `support`.** Those endpoints accept an
  `Idempotency-Key` header server-side (24h cache). The CLI doesn't surface
  that flag yet — re-running a command will file a duplicate Linear issue
  and charge again.
- **Short links are permanent by default.** Omitting `--expires` on
  `short create` means the redirect persists indefinitely — fine for
  business cards, printed QR targets, social bios. Add `--expires` only
  if you want it to lapse.
- **Files are temporary.** `files upload` defaults to a **24-hour** TTL.
  Pass `--expires 7d` for the maximum.
- **Charts payload.** The `--data` JSON is a full Chart.js config (or just
  the inner `data` object — chartsplat accepts both). For OHLC /
  candlestick charts pass `{ x, o, h, l, c }` points.

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `WDH_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY env var is required` | Env var unset | `export WDH_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...` |
| 402 retry fails / `insufficient funds` | Wallet has no USDC on Base | Top up; even $1 covers thousands of small calls |
| `failed: 413` on `files upload` | File >5 GB | Split the upload; 5 GB is the per-call max |
| `failed: 400` on `md publish` | Markdown >1 MB | Trim or split the document |
| `invalid duration` | Bad `--expires` value | Use formats like `30m`, `24h`, `7d` |
| `failed: 503` on `short create --slug` | 8 slug collisions in a row | Pick a different slug or let it auto-generate |
