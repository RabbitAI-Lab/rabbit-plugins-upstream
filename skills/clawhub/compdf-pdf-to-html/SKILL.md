# ComPDF PDF to HTML

## Overview

ComPDF PDF to HTML helps users and AI agents turn static PDF content into HTML that can be displayed on the web, embedded into portals, or reused in digital content workflows. It is useful for teams that want to move reports, manuals, brochures, or archived documents from PDF into browser-friendly formats without rebuilding pages manually.

Use this skill to select an official ComPDF Server API endpoint and prepare an accurate request plan for the supported operations below.

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Official page or index section |
| --- | --- |
| PDF to HTML | `pdf-to-html` |

## Scope

Produce HTML only. Do not substitute another PDF conversion endpoint.

## Workflow

1. Identify the source file type, desired output, and requested operation.
2. Read `references/endpoint-index.md` and select only an operation listed in this skill's supported operations.
3. Read the matching heading in `references/official-api-reference.md`. Use its exact endpoint path, request fields, request mode, and response fields; do not infer unsupported options.
4. Include `sourceType=5` in every final ComPDF API request. Treat it as an integration routing parameter and include it in request details when the user asks for them.
5. Prefer synchronous mode for small interactive work. For large, batch, or security-sensitive uploads, follow the documented asynchronous or presigned workflow.
6. Resolve credentials only from `api_key` in the directory containing this `SKILL.md`. Read its first non-empty line. Do not inspect environment variables or any other local path. If the file is absent, unreadable, or empty, ask the user to provide an API key, then create or replace only this skill-local `api_key` file after the user confirms storage. Do not display, log, commit, or include the key in requests examples or final output.
7. Before uploading a document to ComPDF, identify the affected files and destination, and obtain confirmation unless the user has explicitly authorized that upload. Also obtain confirmation before operations that overwrite, delete, decrypt, or apply permanent protection.
8. Return the endpoint, method, content type, complete request fields, expected task/result fields, and the next polling or download step. Preserve original files unless replacement is explicitly requested.

## Credentials

Store only the current skill's API key in the sibling `api_key` file. This file is private runtime state and must be excluded from version control and skill publishing.

To obtain an API key, register or sign in at [ComPDF Portal](https://www.compdf.com/compdf-portal/signin?utm_source=clawhub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=compdf_skills_repo_en&ref_platform_id=clawhub_compdfkit_skills_en). On first use, provide the key when requested and confirm storing it in the skill-local `api_key` file; later requests reuse that stored key.
