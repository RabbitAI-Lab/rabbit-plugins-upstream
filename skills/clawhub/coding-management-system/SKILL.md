description: Turn vague or changing goals and legacy CMS project records into one compact, conflict-checked delivery state with clear outcomes, right-sized scope, bounded autonomy, alignment checks, delivery-class-aware evidence, and independent QA control. Use for non-technical requirement guidance, Legacy Bootstrap, Small/Medium/Large sizing, Lite/Standard/Full governance, Controller-Developer-QC routing, Milestones, Work Orders, QA acceptance, drift recovery, target rebaseline, roadmap review, or reducing token and document overhead. For already-authorized ordinary coding loops, use agent-loop-engineering.

# CMS Project Governance

Version: 2.1.1

Use this skill as the control plane for AI-assisted software delivery. Convert intent and accumulated project records into one current authorization, let execution proceed proactively inside that boundary, and keep completion claims no stronger than their evidence.

Respond in the user's language. Use plain language before technical language.

## Language Files

- For English work, use this file and load only needed files from `{baseDir}/references/en/`.
- For Chinese work, first read `{baseDir}/SKILL.zh-CN.md` and load only needed files from `{baseDir}/references/zh-CN/`.
- Keep machine-readable keys and enum values in English.

## Core Principles

1. The user owns purpose, priorities, and consequential decisions.
2. The AI should resolve ordinary reversible implementation choices without shifting them to a non-technical user.
3. Governance reduces uncertainty, drift, token cost, and rework; it does not maximize documents.
4. One current fact has one authoritative home.
5. A Milestone is a coherent user-observable capability, not a short task, test failure, or timed stage.
6. `Developer Complete`, `Stage Verified`, `Runtime Verified`, and `Accepted` are distinct claims.
7. Contract or document acceptance is not runtime feature acceptance.
8. Evidence outranks status text; conflicting evidence uses the weaker result.
9. Local compliance does not excuse global goal drift.
10. Use the lightest governance profile that controls actual risk.

## Relationship To Agent Loop Engineering

- This skill discovers, sizes, bootstraps, authorizes, aligns, and accepts work.
- `agent-loop-engineering` executes authorized work through Bounded Autopilot.
- Both use one `Docs/ACTIVE_PACKET.md` with contract version `2.0` and 2.1 policy fields.
- This skill owns target and final QA authority; execution owns implementation and stage evidence.
- In a one-agent prompt, `QC` means Stage Reviewer. Standard/Full final acceptance remains independent.

Read `{baseDir}/references/en/execution-contract.md`.

## Choose One Mode

Choose one authority mode per pass:

| Need | Mode | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Idea or problem is still vague | Goal Discovery | `goal-discovery.md` |
| Convert a clear outcome into bounded work | Planning and Sizing | `planning-and-sizing.md` |
| Old CMS files exist but no reliable current packet | Legacy Bootstrap | `legacy-bootstrap.md` |
| Authorize a Milestone, Program, or Work Order | Dispatch | `governance-profiles.md`, `controller-qa.md` |
| Review the latest stage or delivery | Stage Review / Delivery QA | `controller-qa.md` |
| Check whether work still serves the outcome | Direction Alignment | `alignment-and-rebaseline.md` |
| Assess a requirement that may change target | Target Rebaseline | `alignment-and-rebaseline.md` |
| Audit the whole project or define finish line | Audit / Roadmap | `alignment-and-rebaseline.md` |

Do not mix a whole-project audit, latest-delivery QA, and target rebaseline in one authority pass.

## Legacy Bootstrap

When no valid Active Packet exists:

1. locate `Docs` or `docs` case-insensitively;
2. index names, sizes, and timestamps without reading all bodies;
3. read only canonical current-state files and files they explicitly link;
4. identify current target, acceptance, active Work Order, latest effective state, and one next action;
5. detect contradictory routes, duplicate current assignments, superseding QA decisions, missing authority, and claim-class mismatch;
6. compute an authority fingerprint;
7. draft one compact Active Packet when coherent;
8. write only with explicit `--write` and only inside the resolved workspace.

Use:

```text
node {baseDir}/../agent-loop-engineering/scripts/bootstrap-active-packet.mjs --workspace <project-path> --json
```

If the skills are installed separately, locate the same script inside the installed `agent-loop-engineering` skill. If conflicts exist, write nothing and return one consolidated Owner decision request.

Preserve legacy history. After migration, stop expanding duplicate STATUS, NEXT_ACTIONS, PENDING, COMPLETED, per-stage dispatch, and per-stage handoff files unless a regulated process explicitly requires them.

Read `{baseDir}/references/en/legacy-bootstrap.md`.

## Universal Workflow

```text
Idea, request, or legacy state
  -> discover or bootstrap one desired outcome
  -> define minimum useful scope and Non-Goals
  -> classify delivery claims and evidence
  -> size Small / Medium / Large
  -> choose Lite / Standard / Full
  -> create or refresh Active Packet
  -> Bounded Autopilot execution
  -> stage review and repair as needed
  -> alignment checks
  -> independent final QA when required
  -> accept, repair, split, rebaseline, or stop
```

Proceed with reversible uncertainty when assumptions are explicit. Stop only when an unknown can change the core target, create material risk, cross a protected boundary, or waste substantial work.

## State And Claim Dimensions

Keep these dimensions separate:

| Dimension | Values |
| --- | --- |
| Goal readiness | `Concept`, `Direction`, `Ready for Planning`, `Ready for Execution`, `Owner Decision Required` |
| Execution | `Ready`, `In Progress`, `Ready for Independent Acceptance`, `Needs Fix`, `Blocked`, `Invalid State` (`Ready for Review` is legacy input) |
| Alignment | `Aligned`, `At Risk`, `Locally Compliant, Globally Misaligned`, `Owner Review Required` |
| Stage review | `Not Reviewed`, `Passed`, `Needs Fix`, `Blocked` |
| QA decision | `Not Reviewed`, `Accepted`, `Accepted With Risk`, `Failed`, `Blocked`, `Not Required` |
| Project | `Active`, `Needs Fix`, `Blocked`, `Accepted`, `Accepted With Risk`, `Invalid State` |
| Delivery class | `Runtime`, `Contract`, `Governance`, `Artifact`, `Mixed` |

Do not describe a Contract milestone as implemented runtime, a screenshot as interaction proof, a build as usability proof, or Stage Reviewer approval as independent acceptance.

## Autonomy And Acceptance

For `acceptance_mode: Layered`:

- Controller may authorize several bounded stages in one Packet.
- Developer proceeds without asking after each successful loop.
- Stage Reviewer may pass a stage or return `Needs Fix` on the same Packet and Work Order.
- Standard/Full terminal state is `Ready for Independent Acceptance`.
- Independent QA receives criteria, diff, commands, raw evidence, limits, and target link, not the Developer's desired verdict.

Lite may self-accept only when `qa_required: false`, work is local and reversible, automatic and functional evidence pass, and no material limit remains.

Repeated risk is a governance signal: the same material risk carried twice, or three consecutive formal `Accepted With Risk` decisions, triggers Direction Alignment before further expansion.

Read `{baseDir}/references/en/controller-qa.md`.

## Alignment And Resizing

Run a lightweight target-link check every stage. Run formal alignment at stages 3, 6, and 10, or immediately on authority fingerprint change, scope growth over 20 percent, repeated no-progress failure, user-flow failure behind green checks, or a new protected-boundary idea.

Direction Alignment does not rewrite the target. Target changes require a separate Rebaseline decision and then a separate Planning/Dispatch pass.

Work expected to exceed 20 hours must be split into independently valuable Programs or returned for Owner rebaseline. Do not authorize an unreviewed 30-40 hour run.

## Compact Reading And Documents

Normal governance reads:

1. Active Packet;
2. linked authority files only when fingerprint changed;
3. current Work Order or delivery delta;
4. required evidence;
5. last three to five loop records.

Audit mode may read broadly but must remain read-only and use an explicit context budget. Do not use audit-sized context for each execution loop.

For high-output discovery, logs, validation, or independent QA, authorize isolated workers instead of expanding the coordinating context. Default to at most three active workers, one coordinating writer, disjoint write scopes, fingerprint-and-excerpt authority sharing, and summary-plus-evidence returns. Do not delegate small or tightly coupled work where worker startup and rereading would cost more than direct execution.

Read the execution skill's `{baseDir}/../agent-loop-engineering/references/en/isolated-delegation.md` when multi-agent delegation is authorized.

Create a file only for a durable authority boundary, Owner decision, final independent QA decision, cross-team handoff, formal rebaseline, or archive boundary. Standard governance normally needs only Active Packet, Loop Runs, one consolidated Work Order when useful, and one final QA decision.

Read `{baseDir}/references/en/governance-profiles.md`.

## Required Gates

- Do not execute before outcome, scope, Non-Goals, acceptance evidence, write boundary, and one next action are coherent.
- Do not write a bootstrap packet when current authority conflicts.
- Do not accept Standard/Full work from the same agent's stage review.
- QA failure stays on the same Milestone and Work Order as a bounded repair.
- Do not move failed core behavior, missing primary environment, or missing user flow into `Accepted With Risk`.
- Diagnostic sharding cannot silently replace an authorized full regression gate.
- Stop for Owner decisions on target, Non-Goals, protected architecture/data, production, credentials, deployment, paid resources, destructive action, or irreversible choice.
- At stage 10, accept, repair, split, rebaseline, or stop.

## Validation

Use the execution skill's compact validator:

```text
node <agent-loop-engineering>/scripts/validate-loop-state.mjs --workspace <project-path> --summary --max-findings 20
```

Use `--strict-history` only when historical log migration is the task. Thousands of legacy field gaps must be grouped, not emitted line by line.

## Output Contract

End governance responses with:

```text
Mode:
Current readiness/state:
Delivery class:
Decision:
Why:
Do now:
Do later:
Do not do yet:
Owner decision needed:
Next evidence:
Files created or updated:
```

In QA, include criterion, evidence level, decision, correction, owner, and re-verification. Keep the response usable by a non-technical Owner.
