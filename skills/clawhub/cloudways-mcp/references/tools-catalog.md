# Tools Catalog — Cloudways MCP

The official tool catalog for the **Cloudways (Remote) MCP** (`https://mcp.cloudways.com/mcp/`), taken from the official support articles: [Cloudways MCP Server Tools](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/15798823-cloudways-mcp-server-tools) (the dedicated tool reference) and [How to Use Cloudways MCP Server](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/14654372-how-to-use-cloudways-mcp-server-for-ai-based-server-management) (setup). Tools appear in Claude as `mcp__cloudways__<tool>` (or `mcp__cloudways-<client>__<tool>` per account).

**MCP v1.2 scale:** **244 tools** — 241 spread across 22 toolsets plus the 3 meta-tools, live-verified 2026-07-20 (see the toolset table below). This matches the [v1.2 announcement](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/cloudways-mcp-v1-2-112-new-tools-role-based-access-tokens-and-full-cloudways-api-coverage/) exactly (112 added in v1.2, covering essentially the full Cloudways API). Your client initially sees only **65 tools** (62 high-frequency direct tools + the 3 meta-tools below). Those 62 are **members of the toolsets**, not a separate tier, so the hidden remainder is **179** (241 − 62) — discovered and invoked on demand through the meta-tools.

> **The official tools article over-lists.** It documents endpoint-style aliases for the Security and Service categories (`security_dns_create`, `service_state_update`, …) plus whole categories — Bot Protection, Client Billing, CloudwaysCDN legacy, a "Lists API", `oauth_access_token_generate` — that **have no live counterpart**. Live re-enumeration on 2026-07-20 found 64 such phantom identifiers and **zero** real alias mismatches: every name in the tables below matches the live `tool_name` exactly. They have been removed from this catalog; if you see them in Cloudways' docs, don't build automation on them.

Flags: **R** = read-only · **W** = write (requires confirmation) · **W!** = destructive / irreversible (requires double confirmation).

> The **live server is the source of truth.** Every section of this file — including the "New in MCP v1.2" half — was reconciled against the live MCP on 2026-07-20 via `list_available_toolsets` + `get_toolset_tools` on a connected account: all 22 toolsets enumerated, every tool name verified byte-for-byte, phantom entries removed. You do **not** need to memorize tool names to use the MCP (it resolves natural language), but knowing them sharpens prompts and lets you confirm an action maps to the tool you expect.
>
> **Most tools are grouped into on-demand toolsets.** Only a subset appears in your default tool list; the rest live inside toolsets (`apps`, `servers`, `git`, `ssh_keys`, `projects`, `staging_management`, `dns_made_easy`, `cloudflare`, and the v1.2 additions) and are invoked through the `execute_tool` proxy. A tool being absent from the default list does **not** mean it is absent from the MCP — `git_*`, `project_*`, `ssh_key_*`, `app_restore_rollback`, `app_db_password_update`, `server_local_backup_delete`, and `staging_app_clone*` are all live via their toolsets (live-verified). Note that `staging_app_clone*` lives in the `apps` toolset, not `staging_management`.
>
> **Toolset descriptions overstate their own contents.** `list_available_toolsets` is reliable for *routing* but not as a capability contract — several descriptions advertise operations that have no tool: `staging_management` (delete latest staging backup — actually `app_local_backup_delete` in `apps`), `security` (install custom SSL — only the *remove* counterpart exists), `cloudways_bot` (list/paginate alerts — only the mark-read tools exist), `copilot` (severity summary, alert-by-id — only `copilot_insights_list`), `agency_os` (disconnect agency, subscribe client to plan, attach/cancel client service, client+service summary, mark invoice paid, reminders — none of the 7 exist). Confirm with `get_toolset_tools` before promising a capability.
>
> There is no `ping` / `customer_info` / `rate_limit_status` tool — verify connectivity with `server_list` and identify the account by the connection prefix.
>
> **Last verified:** 2026-07-20 against the **live MCP** (all 22 toolsets enumerated on a connected account); content sourced from the official v1.2 support articles 2026-07-19. **Note:** three categories are split across the two halves of this file — Cloudflare CDN, Add-on Management, and Copilot each have a pre-v1.2 table above and an "expanded in v1.2" table below; check both.

## Live toolset counts (2026-07-20)

| Toolset | Tools | Toolset | Tools |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| `apps` | 52 | `addons` | 10 |
| `servers` | 28 | `dns_made_easy` | 9 |
| `security_suite` | 26 | `monitoring` | 9 |
| `agency_os` | 23 | `copilot` | 9 |
| `cloudflare` | 15 | `cloudways_bot` | 7 |
| `security` | 13 | `services` | 7 |
| `git` | 6 | `projects` | 4 |
| `staging_management` | 5 | `team_member` | 4 |
| `supervisord` | 5 | `ssh_keys` | 3 |
| `app_vulnerability` | 2 | `transfer_server` | 3 |
| `operation` | 1 | `safe_update` | **0** |

**241 toolset tools + 3 meta-tools = 244**, of which 62 toolset members are surfaced directly and the other 179 are on-demand only. `safe_update` is declared by the server but **empty in the current build** — its description states it is "declared but not yet populated", and `execute_tool` returns *"tool not found in toolset"* for anything in it. SafeUpdate (managed WordPress core/plugin/theme updates with visual-regression checks and auto-rollback) is therefore **UI-only** for now; re-check this toolset after future MCP releases.

# New in MCP v1.2 (2026-07)

Everything below was added in Cloudways MCP v1.2 and is documented in the [official tools article](https://support.cloudways.com/en/articles/15798823-cloudways-mcp-server-tools). These categories **close the gaps this catalog previously flagged as "UI/direct-API only"**: SSL / Let's Encrypt, SSH/MySQL/Adminer/Web-SSH IP whitelisting, and team-member management are now MCP tools. Most of these live in on-demand toolsets (invoked via `execute_tool`); R/W/W! risk tags below are this skill's operational assessment, not Cloudways labels.

## Security — SSL & IP Access (new in v1.2)

| Tool | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|--------------|
| `security_lets_encrypt_install` | W | Provision + install a Let's Encrypt SSL cert on an app (HTTP-01 or DNS-01 challenge). |
| `security_lets_encrypt_renew` | W | Force an out-of-cycle renewal of an existing Let's Encrypt cert. |
| `security_lets_encrypt_revoke` | W! | Revoke a Let's Encrypt cert — HTTPS falls back to no SSL (breaks production HTTPS). |
| `security_lets_encrypt_auto_renewal` | W | Toggle Let's Encrypt auto-renewal on/off for an app. |
| `security_remove_own_ssl` | W! | Remove a previously-installed custom (own) SSL cert from an app. |
| `security_create_dns` | W | Create the DNS challenge (TXT) record required to issue a wildcard SSL cert. |
| `security_verify_dns` | W | Verify the published DNS challenge record so the wildcard cert can be issued. |
| `security_get_whitelisted_ips` | R | List IPs whitelisted for SSH/SFTP access on a server. |
| `security_get_whitelisted_ips_mysql` | R | List IPs whitelisted for remote MySQL access. |
| `security_update_whitelisted_ips` | W! | **Replace** the SSH/SFTP or MySQL IP whitelist — overrides the current list; a wrong list can lock you (or the client) out. Always read the current list first. |
| `security_check_blacklisted_ip` | R | Check whether an IP is blacklisted on the server. |
| `security_whitelist_ip_siab` | W | Whitelist an IP for Shell-in-a-Box (browser Web SSH). |
| `security_whitelist_ip_adminer` | W | Whitelist an IP for Adminer (browser DB manager). |

> **13 tools, all live-verified.** The tools article lists endpoint-style aliases for several of these (`security_dns_create`, `security_dns_verify`, `security_lets_encrypt_auto_renewal_update`, `security_mysql_whitelisted_ips_get`, `security_ssh_sftp_whitelisted_ips_get`, `security_whitelisted_ips_update`, `security_ip_blacklist_check`, `security_adminer_allow`, `security_siab_allow`) plus CSR tools (`security_csr_create` / `security_csr_get`) — **none of them exist on the live server.** The names in the table are the real ones.
>
> There is **no tool to install a custom SSL cert** (only `security_remove_own_ssl` to remove one), despite the toolset description claiming otherwise — the install/paste step is UI or direct-API only.

## Still not exposed (use UI or direct API)

- **SSH-key listing** — keys are managed via `ssh_key_create`/`ssh_key_update`/`ssh_key_delete`, but there is no dedicated read/list tool. Key metadata **does** come back inside the `server_get` payload, so audit from there (or the Cloudways UI) rather than assuming the roster is unreadable.
- **SafeUpdate (managed WordPress updates)** — the `safe_update` toolset is declared but empty in the current build (0 tools); scheduling, run-now, history, and auto-rollback are UI-only.
- **Custom SSL install** — `security_remove_own_ssl` removes a custom cert, but there is no install counterpart; paste the cert in the UI or use the direct API.
- **Bot Protection, Client Billing, CloudwaysCDN (legacy), reference-data "Lists API", OAuth token minting** — documented in Cloudways' tools article but **absent from the live MCP**; UI or direct API only.
- **Backup listing** — `app_backup_status_get` reports only an in-progress backup; available restore points are visible in the UI.
- **Account/plan info** — no `customer_info` tool; plan/billing status of the Cloudways account itself is UI-only.
