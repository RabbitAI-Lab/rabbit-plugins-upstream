# Miremo Skill for OpenClaw

Access your [Miremo](https://miremoapp.com) notes, documents, supertags, knowledge graph, and reusable method skills directly from OpenClaw via MCP.

## Prerequisites

This skill requires the Miremo MCP server to be connected in OpenClaw. Complete the following setup first.

---

## Step 1: Generate a Miremo API Key

1. Open the Miremo app → **Settings → Preferences**
2. Find the **API Key** section and click **New API Key**
3. Enter a name (e.g. `OpenClaw`) and confirm
4. **Copy the key immediately** (format: `sk-miremo-xxxx`) — it won't be shown again

---

## Step 2: Add the MCP Server to OpenClaw

Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` and add under `mcp.servers`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "miremo": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://api.miremoapp.com/mcp/v1/mcp",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer sk-miremo-YOUR_KEY_HERE"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> For local development, use `http://localhost:8000/mcp/v1/mcp` as the URL.

---

## Step 3: Install This Skill

```bash
openclaw skills install miremo
```

Start a new OpenClaw session and the Miremo tools will be available.

## Security Notes

- Treat your API Key like a password — never commit it to version control
- Revoke unused keys anytime in Miremo settings
- Create separate keys for different clients for independent management
