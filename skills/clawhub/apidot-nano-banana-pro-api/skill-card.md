### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT-0 <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and agents use this skill to route Nano Banana Pro image generation and editing work to APIDot documentation, examples, async task handling, polling, and webhook guidance. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: APIDot API keys could be exposed if copied into browser code, public repositories, logs, screenshots, or chat output. <br>
Mitigation: Keep APIDOT_API_KEY in server-side environment variables or a backend secret manager and avoid logging keys, private prompts, image URLs, or callback URLs. <br>
Risk: Nano Banana Pro request fields, availability, limits, or commercial terms may change outside this documentation-only skill. <br>
Mitigation: Check the current APIDot docs and model page before preparing payloads or making product, reliability, or pricing claims. <br>
Risk: Async generation jobs can lose state or create duplicate visible results if task IDs and webhook callbacks are not handled carefully. <br>
Mitigation: Persist task_id, selected model, user context, source media references, status, and final image URLs together, and make webhook handlers idempotent. <br>
