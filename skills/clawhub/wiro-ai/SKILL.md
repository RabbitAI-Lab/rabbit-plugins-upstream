# Wiro AI

Wiro runs AI models for images, video, audio and speech, LLMs, 3D and more through one API.
Each run creates a task. A task is billed to the project's prepaid wallet only if it succeeds.

## Choose a route

- **You are making something for the user now and Wiro MCP tools are available** (`search_models`, `get_model_schema`, `run_model` and others): use them, they call the API below for you. Call `get_account` first to check the connection and the balance, and read `get_playbook` (topics such as `models`, `workflows`, `agents`, `billing`) before a multi-step job.
- **You are writing application code, or there are no MCP tools:** use the REST API at `https://api.wiro.ai/v1`. The HTTP endpoints in steps 1 to 4 are all POST.
- **Chat or LLM calls from code that uses an OpenAI or Anthropic SDK:** use the LLM gateway (see LLMs).

Connecting the MCP server, if the user wants it:

- Hosted: `https://mcp.wiro.ai/v1` (Streamable HTTP). The user signs in with the browser, or the client sends `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (API Key Only project) or `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY:YOUR_API_SECRET` (Signature project). Claude Code: `claude mcp add --transport http wiro https://mcp.wiro.ai/v1`, then `/mcp` to sign in. If the Wiro plugin (wiroai/Wiro-Plugin) is installed, the server is already there: open `/mcp`, pick it and choose Authenticate.
- Local: `npx -y @wiro-ai/wiro-mcp` (stdio, Node.js 20+) with `WIRO_API_KEY`, plus `WIRO_API_SECRET` for a Signature project, in the server's environment.
- MCP names models `owner/model` in lowercase. `run_model` takes `model` and `params` (the fields from `get_model_schema`).

## Credentials

- Read them from environment variables: `WIRO_API_KEY`, plus `WIRO_API_SECRET` for a Signature project. Never print, log or echo them. Never hard-code or commit them (keep `.env` files out of git). Never put them in browser or mobile app code: call Wiro from a server.
- If they are missing, ask the user to create a project at https://wiro.ai/panel/project/new and set the variables themselves. Do not ask them to paste a key into the chat.
- The project's auth method decides the headers:
  - **API Key Only:** `x-api-key`.
  - **Signature:** `x-api-key`, `x-nonce` (a Unix timestamp or random integer) and `x-signature`, the hex HMAC-SHA256 of `API_SECRET + NONCE` keyed with `API_KEY`. Sign every request: compute the pair right before each call.

```bash
NONCE=$(date +%s)
SIGNATURE=$(printf '%s' "${WIRO_API_SECRET}${NONCE}" \
  | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "${WIRO_API_KEY}" | awk '{print $NF}')
# add to the curl call: -H "x-nonce: ${NONCE}" -H "x-signature: ${SIGNATURE}"
```

- The LLM gateway and the hosted MCP server do not take the nonce and signature. They take `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`, or `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY:YOUR_API_SECRET` for a Signature project.
- An auth error means the signature headers are missing, or the key and secret do not belong to the same project.

The examples below use API Key Only. For a Signature project, add the two headers.

## 1. Find a model

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/Tool/List" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-api-key: ${WIRO_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{"search": "flux", "limit": "20", "summary": true, "hideworkflows": true}'
```

- Other filters: `categories` (such as `["text-to-video"]`), `slugowner`, and `start` for paging. Or browse https://wiro.ai/models.
- `cleanslugowner` and `cleanslugproject` in each result are the `{owner-slug}/{model-slug}` you run.
- Read the model before running it:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/Tool/Detail" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-api-key: ${WIRO_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{"slugowner": "OWNER_SLUG", "slugproject": "MODEL_SLUG"}'
```

- `tool[0].parameters[].items[]` lists the inputs: `id` (the field name to send), `type` and `required`, plus allowed options and defaults where the model sets them. Build the request from these ids.

## 2. Work out the cost

- `dynamicprice` (in Tool/List and Tool/Detail) is an array of `{inputs, price, priceMethod}`, with `price` in USD. Use the entry whose `inputs` match the settings you will send; `{}` means one price for every setting. Parse it first if it arrives as a string.
- `priceMethod`: `cpr` per run, `cpo` per output file, `cps` per second of run time, `cpt` per token, `cp-pixel` per 1024x1024 tier of output, `cp-audiosecondslength` per second of input audio, `cp-promptlength` per prompt character, `cp-outputVideoLength` per second of output video, `cp-realtimeturn` per realtime turn, `cp-readoutput` reported by the model when it ends.
- No `dynamicprice`: the model bills per second, and `approximatelycost` (from its average run time) is a rough estimate.
- Only successful runs (`pexit: "0"`) are billed. Failed runs, server errors, queue time and tasks cancelled before processing completes are not.
- Prices are also listed at https://wiro.ai/product/pricing.

## 3. Run the model

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/Run/{owner-slug}/{model-slug}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-api-key: ${WIRO_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{"prompt": "A futuristic city at sunset"}'
# {"result": true, "errors": [], "taskid": "...", "socketaccesstoken": "..."}
```

- Keep `taskid` and `socketaccesstoken` (the task token) right away. They are how you find the task again.
- Models without file inputs take JSON. Models with file inputs take `multipart/form-data`, for example `-F "inputImage=@photo.jpg" -F "scale=4"`.
- Files by URL: a `fileinput` takes it in `{id}Url` (`inputImageUrl`), and in multipart you send both fields with one left empty. A `multifileinput` takes comma-separated URLs in the field with `Url` before `Multiple` (`inputDocumentUrlMultiple`). A `combinefileinput` takes URLs in the field itself. URLs must be public http(s), redirects included.
- To reuse a local file across runs, upload it once with `POST /File/Upload` (multipart field `file`, up to 100 MB) and pass the returned `url`.
- An optional `callbackUrl` gets a webhook when the task ends (see below).

## 4. Get the result

**Poll** Task/Detail with the task token or the task id:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://api.wiro.ai/v1/Task/Detail" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-api-key: ${WIRO_API_KEY}" \
  -d '{"tasktoken": "TASK_TOKEN"}'   # or -d '{"taskid": "TASK_ID"}'
```

- Read `tasklist[0]`. Check every 3 seconds or so, less often for long jobs, until `status` is `task_postprocess_end` or `task_cancel`. Nothing else ends a task.
- Statuses run `task_queue`, `task_accept`, `task_preprocess_start`, `task_preprocess_end`, `task_assign`, `task_start`, `task_output` (repeats), `task_output_full`, `task_end`, `task_postprocess_start`, `task_postprocess_end`. `task_error` is not terminal, and `task_end` comes before the outputs are ready.
- Failed runs also reach `task_postprocess_end`: `pexit: "0"` means success, anything else is a failure (and not billed).
- Files are in `outputs[].url` (with `name` and `contenttype`). LLM text is in `debugoutput`, or ordered in `outputs[0].content.segments`. The charge is `totalcost`, in USD.

**WebSocket:** connect to `wss://socket.wiro.ai/v1`, send `{"type": "task_info", "tasktoken": "TASK_TOKEN"}` and read events until `task_postprocess_end`. Its `success` and `exitCode` (`0` = success) give the outcome, and `message` holds the outputs. Realtime voice, text-to-speech and speech-to-text models also work over this socket: see https://wiro.ai/docs/websocket.

**Webhook:** with `callbackUrl`, Wiro POSTs the task as JSON when it ends, success or failure, so check `pexit`. Answer with a 2xx at once. It tries up to 3 times, 2 seconds apart, and does not follow redirects. Match the task id against your own records before you act on the payload. Webhooks go to public URLs; on a local machine, poll instead.

**Sync:** `POST /Run/{owner-slug}/{model-slug}/sync` starts the same billed task and holds the request for up to 40 minutes, then returns Task Detail JSON (check `tasklist[0].pexit`). Add `?stream=true` for SSE events. A timeout returns HTTP 504 with `taskid` and `socketaccesstoken`, and the task keeps running. Training and realtime models use the other routes, not `/sync`.

## Money rules

- Before any paid run, tell the user the model, the settings and the expected cost in one line.
- Ask first for large, batch or open-ended jobs (many outputs, long videos, loops), and for any paid run the user did not ask for, retries included.
- After a timeout, a 504 or a dropped connection, never send the same Run again on your own. The task may still be running, and a second Run is a second billed job. Look it up first with Task/Detail (MCP: `wait_for_task`, `get_task`, `list_tasks`). With no task id at all, check MCP `list_tasks` or `get_account` with `recent_transactions`, or ask the user to check their usage at https://wiro.ai/panel/billing, before you resend.
- MCP: `run_model` waits up to 45 seconds by default, then returns the running task with a `nextAction` (usually `wait_for_task`). Call that. Never call `run_model` again for the same job.
- Stop a task only when the user asks: `POST /Task/Cancel` with `{"taskid": "TASK_ID"}` while it is queued, `POST /Task/Kill` with `{"taskid": "TASK_ID"}` or `{"socketaccesstoken": "TASK_TOKEN"}` once it is running. It ends as `task_cancel`. MCP: `cancel_task`, `kill_task`.
- The project behind the key decides which wallet pays, personal or team. Only the user adds funds, in the dashboard at https://wiro.ai/panel/billing; no MCP tool adds funds.

## LLMs

- LLMs in the catalog run through Run like other models, with the reply in `debugoutput` and `outputs[0].content`. A chat model keeps context when you send the same `session_id` on every turn, if its parameters list `session_id`.
- For OpenAI-style code, use the gateway at base URL `https://llm.wiro.ai/v1`: `POST /chat/completions` and `POST /responses`. Anthropic SDKs use the origin `https://llm.wiro.ai` (`/v1/messages`).
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` for API Key Only, `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY:YOUR_API_SECRET` for Signature.
- Model ids are lowercase `owner/model`. `GET /v1/models` lists the gateway models; check `capabilities.endpoints` and `supported_parameters` before you rely on a feature. LLMs missing from that list still run through Run.
- Send the conversation history in `messages` on every request. Output is text only; make images, video and audio through Run.
- `max_completion_tokens` also covers reasoning tokens, so keep it at 512 or more.
- The billed amount is in `usage.cost`.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://llm.wiro.ai/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${WIRO_API_KEY}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "owner/model", "max_completion_tokens": 512,
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is SSE?"}]}'
```

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const { WIRO_API_KEY, WIRO_API_SECRET } = process.env;
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://llm.wiro.ai/v1",
  apiKey: WIRO_API_SECRET ? `${WIRO_API_KEY}:${WIRO_API_SECRET}` : WIRO_API_KEY,
});

const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "owner/model", // an id from GET /v1/models
  max_completion_tokens: 512,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }],
});
console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

## Workflows

A workflow is a saved chain of model steps and built-in utility steps, with its own inputs and outputs. Start one with `POST /Workflow/Run` (`slug` is its full slug, `input` the input values); it returns a `workflowtoken`. Poll `POST /Workflow/RunDetail` with that token until `status` is `completed`, `failed`, `stopped` or `cancelled`. Each model step is billed like a normal run when it succeeds, and utility steps are not billed. The wallet must hold 0.50 USD per model step to start, and the expected cost is the sum of the step models' prices. A failed run can be resumed without paying again for finished steps. MCP: `list_workflows`, `run_workflow`, `wait_for_workflow_run`, `resume_workflow_run`. See https://wiro.ai/docs/workflows.

## Hosted agents

Wiro Agents are assistants that keep running on Wiro: they keep conversation memory, connect to outside services and use tools. You deploy one from a template (browse https://wiro.ai/agents) or build one from skills. Each agent runs on a monthly Starter or Pro plan with a pool of credits, and every turn uses credits by the tokens its model consumes. Deploying through the API takes the plan price from the wallet at once, so quote it and get a clear yes first. MCP: `list_agent_templates`, `deploy_agent` (quotes first, and charges only when called again with `confirm: true`), `send_agent_message`. See https://wiro.ai/docs/agent-overview.

## Errors and limits

Check `result` first, then `errors[].code`. Do not rely on the HTTP status alone.

| Code | Meaning | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | Validation, missing parameter or server error | Fix the request; retry a server error with backoff |
| `1` | Model or task not found or not accessible | Check the slug, task id or token |
| `96` | Concurrency limit reached | No task was created and nothing was charged; retry after 2, 4, 8 s (up to 60 s, at most 8 tries) or queue |
| `97` | Insufficient balance | The user adds funds; a run needs at least 0.50 USD (10 USD for training models) |
| `98` | The model needs a signed-in account | Use authenticated credentials |
| `99` | Bearer token missing, invalid or expired | Check the credentials |

- How many tasks can run at once depends on the wallet balance: see https://wiro.ai/docs/concurrency-limits. A task counts from `task_queue` until `task_postprocess_end` or `task_cancel`, and tasks started on the website, by agents or by workflows count too.
- On HTTP 429, back off and retry. The LLM gateway sends `retry-after`.
