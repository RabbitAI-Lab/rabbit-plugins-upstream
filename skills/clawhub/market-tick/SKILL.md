# market-tick

## What It Does
Minimal live tick in one small JSON object: BTC, ETH and SOL prices, a one-word market regime, the Fear & Greed value, and a momentum label. Prices are Hyperliquid mid prices (with a secondary feed if Hyperliquid does not price a coin); regime is APEX's BTC regime classification; momentum is an ADX + volume label on BTC. If any input is unavailable the endpoint answers 503 and you are not charged.

## When to Use
- For a cheap, frequent BTC/ETH/SOL price check
- To read the current market regime and sentiment in one call
- As a lightweight polling input for a trading agent

## How to Use
The agent makes an x402-authenticated GET request to:

```
https://apexrunner.ai/signals/market-tick
```

The x402 client handles payment authorisation automatically. No API key, no account, no subscription required — just an EVM wallet with USDC on Base mainnet.

```python
# Example using the x402-python client
from x402.client import x402_get

response = x402_get(
    url="https://apexrunner.ai/signals/market-tick",
    private_key=os.environ["EVM_PRIVATE_KEY"]
)
print(response.json())
```

## Example Response
```json
{
  "btc": 67482.50,
  "eth": 3541.20,
  "sol": 152.30,
  "regime": "RANGING",
  "momentum": "BUILDING",
  "fg": 42,
  "timestamp": "2026-06-23T14:00:00Z"
}
```

## Pricing
**$0.02/call** — standard price

Every caller is charged $0.014/call until 2027-01-01 under the
early-adopter discount (30% off the standard price). No tier, no wallet
history, no enrolment — that is simply the price.
