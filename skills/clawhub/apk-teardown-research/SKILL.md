# APK teardown research

Submit Android packages for static analysis and compare completed teardown
jobs as normalized JSON. This skill is for authorized analysis of packages you
are allowed to inspect.

## When to use this skill

- Inspect manifest, permissions, signing, SDK, library, and tech-stack signals.
- Diff two versions of the same app.
- Build a multi-version release timeline.
- Compare two different packages for possible common ownership signals.

## Setup

- Get a Crawlora API key at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=crawlora-skills).
- `export CRAWLORA_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here`
- Requests use `x-api-key: $CRAWLORA_API_KEY` against `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`.

## How it works

Submit one `.apk`/`.xapk` or HTTPS `file_url` with
`/apk-teardown/jobs`. Poll the returned job path until complete, then use
`/apk-teardown/diff`, `/apk-teardown/timeline`, or
`/apk-teardown/compare-ownership` with completed job ids. Never submit
packages or URLs without the necessary authorization.
