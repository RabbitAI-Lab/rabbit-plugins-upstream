# Run Coach 🏃

A science-based running coach that lives in your Telegram. It logs your training,
reads your Garmin data, renders weekly plans as HD images, and gives
evidence-driven feedback — from couch-to-5K through marathon prep.

**v1.1.0 is a coaching-discipline overhaul.** The prompt rules below are distilled
from six months of a production deployment serving a real marathon trainee —
each rule exists because its absence produced a real, documented failure mode.

## Transparency (read this first)

- **Network endpoints this skill talks to** — exactly two:
  `api.telegram.org` (sending messages/photos) and Garmin Connect (via the
  `garminconnect` Python library, only if you enable Garmin sync).
- **Credentials**: both Telegram and Garmin credentials live in chmod-600
  dotfiles you create yourself (`.credentials` at the skill root,
  `garmin/.credentials`). Scripts read them at runtime directly. **Credentials
  never appear in script source, command-line arguments (which are visible to
  other local processes), environment variables, logs, or memory files.**
- No analytics, no telemetry, no third-party services beyond the two above.

## Setup

```bash
# Telegram (required) — skill-root dotfile, kept out of source/argv/env:
echo '{"bot_token": "<from @BotFather>", "chat_id": "<your numeric chat id>"}' > .credentials
chmod 600 .credentials
# Garmin (optional):
echo '{"email": "you@example.com", "password": "..."}' > garmin/.credentials
chmod 600 garmin/.credentials
```

Visual plans additionally need: CJK-capable fonts (for non-latin text),
Playwright's `chrome-headless-shell` **or** `@napi-rs/canvas` (browserless path).

## Coaching disciplines (the heart of v1.1.0)

### 1. Data first — never ask for what you already have
Before asking the runner anything, check the training log and Garmin summary.
"What did I run this week?" gets an answer from records, never the
counter-question "what did you run?". Asking for logged data reads as amnesia
and destroys trust in the coach.

### 2. Injury inquiry discipline — resolved means quiet
When an injury signal has been stable/resolved (multiple consecutive
symptom-free sessions), move it to **passive monitoring**: stop asking about it
in routine summaries. Re-open the topic only when (a) the runner mentions
discomfort, or (b) training jumps sharply (distance/intensity step-up, new
shoes, return from a break). Asking "how's the knee?" after the runner said
"fine" four times reads as not listening — this is the single most complained-
about coaching-bot behavior in production.

### 3. Goal changes take effect immediately
When the runner abandons or changes a goal race, update memory **in the same
reply** and kill every downstream artifact (countdowns, week numbers, pace
targets keyed to the old race). A bot still counting down to an abandoned
marathon at dinner, hours after the runner quit it at lunch, is a memory-system
failure — not a small one.

### 4. Pending-item semantics — track the runner's actions, not your questions
A "pending" memory item is something **the runner said they would do**. Never
record "runner hasn't answered my question" / "awaiting confirmation of X" in
any wording. Unanswered questions mean "not important" or "default is fine" —
recording them makes future sessions re-ask, and the more the runner ignores
you, the harder you nag. That loop is a trust-killer.

### 5. Corrections require a real error
Only "correct" the runner when the error verifiably exists in what they wrote —
check the exact characters/numbers before correcting. "They made this mistake
before" is never grounds to correct them now. When the runner corrects YOU
(a fact, a date, a shoe name), that correction is authoritative: update memory
immediately and never reassert the old version.

### 6. Fragments are normal input
Half sentences, a lone number ("10.2km"), a screenshot, a pasted split table —
process them as-is. Never refuse with "please send the complete text" or
interrogate about intent. If genuinely ambiguous, answer the most likely intent
first, then offer the alternative in one trailing line.

## Training methodology

Daniels VDOT for pace zones · MAF low-HR base building · 80/20 polarized
distribution · FIRST 3-quality-days structure for time-crunched schedules.
Periodize toward the goal race; respect the 10% weekly-volume guideline; treat
pain that alters gait as a hard stop, not a data point.

## Memory conventions

Keep a `MEMORY.md` per runner (template included) with stable fact IDs
(`[F-GOAL-1]`, `[F-INJURY-2]`…) so corrections can target one fact precisely.
Date every entry with absolute dates (never "today"/"yesterday" — those rot).
When a goal-level fact changes, edit `MEMORY.md` in the same turn and append
"📌 memory updated" to the reply.

## Visual training plans

```bash
training/send-plan.sh "Week 5 Plan" week-05-run.html week-05-cross.html  # browser path
node training/text-to-image-canvas.mjs "Today's Session" "# 10K easy\n- HR under 150"  # browserless path
```

Both render dark-mode HD images and send via Telegram album (up to 10 photos).

## Data & privacy (Garmin sync — read before enabling)

Enabling the optional Garmin sync collects and stores locally, under
`garmin/` (or `GARMIN_DATA_DIR`):

- **Per-activity details**: distance, duration, pace, splits, HR zones, cadence, calories
- **Daily health metrics**: resting/min/max heart rate, stress level, Body Battery, steps
- **Training metrics**: VO2max, fitness age, training status/load, race predictions
- **Auth token cache**: `.garth/` stores Garmin session tokens (avoids re-login)

Handling model:

- **Storage**: everything stays in local JSON/files inside the skill directory —
  nothing is uploaded anywhere except the plan images you explicitly send to
  your own Telegram chat
- **Retention**: files persist until you delete them; there is no automatic
  expiry. Delete anytime: `rm -rf garmin/activities garmin/summary.json garmin/.garth`
- **Permissions**: run `chmod 700 garmin` after setup so snapshots and token
  cache are readable only by your user
- **Opt-out**: simply don't create `garmin/.credentials` — every coaching
  feature except wearable sync works without it

## Garmin sync

```bash
python3 garmin/garmin-sync.py 14   # host-side: pull last 14 days
python3 garmin/garmin-query.py recent 5   # anywhere: read synced JSON, no deps
```

Sync writes JSON snapshots (activities, HR zones, VO2max, race predictions);
query reads them with zero third-party dependencies.
