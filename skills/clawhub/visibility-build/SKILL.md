description: Build the one missing asset that unlocks the most listings for a project - a remote MCP server, server.json, a one-job browser extension, an API-wrapper CLI, an OpenAPI file, llms.txt docs - or a platform's own integration (n8n node, Make app, Notion connection), from a short recipe sourced from the platform's docs.

Build one asset in the project repo so that more platforms in the visibility catalog accept it. Building is local work. Publishing, pushing and listing happen in `register`, one platform at a time.

Resolve from this file's directory:

- `recipes/<id>.md`: one recipe per asset id (from `ASSETS` in `../plan/scripts/scan.py`) or per platform id (an integration only that platform uses, such as an n8n node). Each recipe gives the smallest version, the official scaffold, the fields the listings check, tagged steps, and a local verify command, with the docs page it came from.
- `../plan/catalog.json`: which platforms the asset unlocks. If this skill was installed without its siblings, read the catalog from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrenSegal/visibility/main/skills/plan/catalog.json and recipes from the same repo under `skills/build/recipes/`.

## Rules

- **Only build what the product's users would use.** The asset does one job the product already does, through its existing API, docs or code. If it would be off-brand or would need a feature the product lacks, say so and stop. A listing is not a reason to build something users don't need.
- **The project's real code is the source.** Read the API routes, auth scheme, README and existing OpenAPI before writing. Never invent endpoints.
- **Steps run by kind**, as in `register`: `claude:` do it; `approve:` show the command and what becomes public, then wait for a yes; `human:` give the user a checklist (accounts, payment, credentials, DNS, forms, video).
- **No secrets in files.** Use `<YOUR_API_KEY>` placeholders, and read keys from the environment.
- **Delegate** where a recipe says to: MCP servers to `mcp-server-dev:build-mcp-server` or `anthropic-skills:mcp-builder`, SKILL.md to `anthropic-skills:skill-creator`, tests for new code to `mattpocock-skills:tdd`.
- **A recipe marked "(unconfirmed)" or older than 90 days**: open its `source` page first and follow the live docs. Then update the recipe and its date.

## Steps

1. **Pick.** With no argument, run `python3 ../plan/scripts/scan.py <path>` and take the top entry under "One asset away" that has a recipe. Show what it unlocks, then go ahead. An `ask` asset without a recipe (test account, demo video, Apple membership) gets a one-line checklist for the user, not a build.
2. **Fit.** Write one sentence naming the job this asset does for the product's users. If you can't, stop.
3. **Build** in the project repo, following the recipe's Smallest version, Scaffold and Fields sections, in its own folder (for example `extension/`, `cli/`, `mcp/`) unless the recipe says otherwise.
4. **Verify locally** with the recipe's command, and add a small test for any new logic.
5. **Re-scan.** Run `scan.py` again. The asset should now be detected, or declared with `--have` for `ask` assets such as `mcp-remote`. Name the newly eligible platforms.
6. **Hand off.** Say what is ready and what is left. The next step is `/visibility:register <platform-id>` for the top newly eligible platform. Don't commit or push unless the user asks.

Done when the asset passes its local verify command, the scan shows the platforms it unlocked, and the user has the remaining `human:` steps.
