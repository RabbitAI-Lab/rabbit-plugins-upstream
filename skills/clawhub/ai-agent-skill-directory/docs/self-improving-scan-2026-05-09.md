## The CertainLogic Bundle

**Recommended combination for maximum self-improvement:**

```bash
# Foundation — must have
clawhub install self-improving      # Tier 1 — general purpose

# Proactivity — choose one
clawhub install proactive            # Tier 1 — advanced (recommended)
# OR
clawhub install openclaw-proactive-agent-lite  # Tier 1 — lightweight

# Memory — choose one
clawhub install memory               # Tier 1 — infinite organized
# OR
clawhub install elite-longterm-memory  # Tier 1 — enterprise (needs API key)

# Learning enhancement
clawhub install learning             # Tier 1 — adaptive learning
clawhub install hermes-learning-loop # Tier 1 — skill extraction
```

### Integration Notes

All three work together:
- **self-improving** provides the core reflection loop
- **proactive** adds anticipation + WAL + heartbeat
- **memory** provides infinite storage for learnings
- **learning** adapts to user preferences
- **hermes-learning-loop** auto-extracts skills from success

**No conflicts:** Each addresses different layer (reflection vs proactivity vs storage vs adaptation vs extraction).

## Key Findings

**Finding #1:** Self-improving is the most crowded category on ClawHub (10+ skills)
**Finding #2:** Majority are clones/forks of the same 2-3 core concepts
**Finding #3:** ClawHub scores broadly correlate with quality but not perfectly (some 3.x skills are better than 4.x)
**Finding #4:** Chinese skills (keep-learning-agent) are competitive with English ones
**Finding #5:** Most skills lack API/query engines — markdown documentation only
**Finding #6:** Proactive + memory integration is rare (proactive by Hal Labs is the exception)

## Recommendations for Skill Oracle

**Immediate:**
- ✅ Add "self-improving" to Verified Skills table
- ✅ Add "proactive" (Hal Labs) to Verified Skills table
- ✅ Add "memory" to Verified Skills table
- ✅ Add "learning" to Verified Skills table
- ⚠️ Monitor "elite-longterm-memory" for stability (API key required)

**For Phase 2:**
- Build "CertainLogic Self-Improving Stack" meta-package that installs all 5 Tier 1 skills + integration guide
- Create comparison matrix: features vs complexity vs use case
- Auto-scan ClawHub monthly for new entrants
