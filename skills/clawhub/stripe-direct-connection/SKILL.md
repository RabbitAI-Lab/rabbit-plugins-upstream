## What This Tool Does
Connect your AI agents to Stripe in seconds. Give agents full read/write control over customers, products, prices, subscriptions, invoices, refunds, payment links, coupons, and disputes — no SDK install, no integration code, just one credential.

Use it to launch SaaS subscription billing with recurring monthly or annual prices, automate accounts receivable by issuing and finalizing invoices, generate hosted Stripe Checkout payment links for e-commerce orders, run customer-support refund flows with reason tracking, manage promotional coupon campaigns, and retrieve real-time account balances. The integration also supports Stripe's full query syntax for searching payment intents, charges, customers, and invoices, plus an interactive integration recommender that maps your business requirements to the right Stripe products (Checkout, Elements, Billing, Connect). Built for agentic workflows in SaaS billing, e-commerce, marketplace payments, donation processing, and finance automation.

## Live Schema And Examples
Use the compact schema above for ordinary calls. Before a new production integration, or whenever parameters, enum values, nested objects, outputs, or examples are unclear, fetch live details first.

- Exact schema: call `agentpmt-tool-search-and-execution` with `action: "get_schema"`, and `tool_id: "stripe-direct-connection"`.
- Detailed examples: call `agentpmt-tool-search-and-execution` with `action: "get_instructions"` and `tool_id: "stripe-direct-connection"`, or call this product with `action: "get_instructions"` when the product tool is already selected.
- Treat returned live schema and instructions as more specific than this generated summary.

MCP schema lookup through the main AgentPMT MCP server:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "AgentPMT-Tool-Search-and-Execution",
    "arguments": {
      "action": "get_schema",
      "tool_id": "stripe-direct-connection"
    }
  }
}
```

For live examples, keep the same MCP tool and use these arguments:

```json
{
  "action": "get_instructions",
  "tool_id": "stripe-direct-connection"
}
```

Authenticated AgentPMT REST schema lookup body:

```json

```

Use the setup skill for the account connection details before making REST calls.

## Response Handling
- Treat the returned JSON as the source of truth for this tool call.
- If the response includes warnings or correction targets, apply them before retrying.
- If the response includes a `passed` or success-style boolean, use it as the workflow gate.
- If validation fails or the response shape is unclear, call `get_schema` or `get_instructions` before retrying.
- If `cancel_subscription` fails, preserve the request parameters and retry only after fixing schema, auth, or payment errors.

## Security
- Do not place account secrets, wallet private keys, mnemonics, signatures, or payment headers in prompts or logs.
- Keep tool inputs scoped to the minimum content needed for the task.
- Use the setup skills for credential handling; this product skill only defines product-specific behavior.
