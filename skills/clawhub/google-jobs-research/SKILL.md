# Google Jobs search

Search Google's public careers site and pull one posting's full detail —
description, responsibilities, and qualifications — as normalized JSON from
the Crawlora API, no scraping careers.google.com by hand.

## When to use this skill

- "Search for <role> jobs at Google in <location>."
- "What is Google currently hiring for in <team/location>?"
- "Pull the full detail (description, responsibilities, qualifications) for Google job id <id>."
- "Track new Google Jobs postings for <role> over time."

## Setup (one-time)

- Get a free Crawlora API key (2,000 credits/mo, no card) at [https://crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=crawlora-skills).
- `export CRAWLORA_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here`
- All requests: `x-api-key: $CRAWLORA_API_KEY` against
  `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`. Missing/invalid key → `401`.

## How it works

1. **Search** — `/google-jobs/search` takes a required `q` (search query),
   plus optional `location` (free text) and `page` (1-based). It parses
   careers.google.com's server-rendered search page's embedded job data, so
   each result already includes the description, responsibilities, and
   qualifications inline — no second call needed just to read a listing.
   Page size is fixed by Google at 20 results; pass `page` to walk further
   pages.
2. **Job detail** — `/google-jobs/job` takes the required `id` (the numeric
   Google job id returned by search) and re-fetches that single posting's
   full server-rendered detail page. Use it to refresh one posting or to
   fetch a job by id when you already have it from elsewhere (e.g. a saved
   link).

Full endpoint list, methods, and params: [`reference/endpoints.md`](reference/endpoints.md).

## Calling the API

```sh
# Search:
scripts/crawlora.sh /google-jobs/search q="software engineer" location="Mountain View" | jq '.'

# Job detail by id:
scripts/crawlora.sh /google-jobs/job id=123456789012345 | jq '.'
```

Raw `curl` fallback:

```sh
curl -fsS -H "x-api-key: $CRAWLORA_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1/google-jobs/search?q=product+manager&location=Remote" | jq '.'
```

## Endpoint reference

See [`reference/endpoints.md`](reference/endpoints.md) for both Google Jobs
endpoints this skill uses.

## Examples

- **Role search in a location:** `/google-jobs/search` with
  `q="data scientist"` and `location="New York"`, paging with `page=2`,
  `page=3` to collect more than 20 results.
- **Track a specific posting:** save the `id` from a search result, then poll
  `/google-jobs/job` for that `id` on a schedule to detect edits or removal
  (a `404`/empty response signals the posting closed).

## Notes & limits

- **Credits / pay-on-success:** billed only on `2xx`; free tier 2,000 credits/mo.
  Key at [https://crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=crawlora-skills).
- **Public data only** — public careers.google.com postings; respect Google's terms.
- **Security:** key lives in `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` only — never hardcode, query-param, or commit it.
- **Page size is fixed at 20** by Google — there's no `limit`/`per_page`
  param, only `page` to move through results.
- **`id` must be the numeric Google job id** from a search result's `id`
  field, not a slug or URL.
