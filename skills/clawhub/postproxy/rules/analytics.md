# Analytics — Post Stats

Per-post performance snapshots over time. For profile-level stats (follower growth, page insights) see [profiles.md](profiles.md).

## Get Post Stats
Retrieves stats snapshots for one or more posts. Returns all matching snapshots so you can see trends over time.
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.postproxy.dev/api/posts/stats?post_ids=abc123,def456&profiles=instagram,twitter&from=2026-02-01T00:00:00Z&to=2026-02-24T00:00:00Z" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $POSTPROXY_API_KEY"
```

Query parameters:
- `post_ids` (required): Comma-separated list of post hashids (max 50)
- `profiles` (optional): Comma-separated list of profile hashids or network names (e.g. `instagram,twitter`)
- `from` (optional): ISO 8601 timestamp — only include snapshots at or after this time
- `to` (optional): ISO 8601 timestamp — only include snapshots at or before this time

Response is keyed by post hashid, each containing a `platforms` array with `profile_id`, `platform`, and `records` (snapshots ordered by `recorded_at` ascending). Each record has a `stats` object (platform-specific metrics) and `recorded_at` timestamp.

## Stats Fields by Platform

| Platform | Fields |
|----------|--------|
| Instagram | `impressions`, `likes`, `comments`, `saved`, `profile_visits`, `follows` |
| Facebook | `impressions`, `clicks`, `likes` |
| Threads | `impressions`, `likes`, `replies`, `reposts`, `quotes`, `shares` |

| TikTok | `impressions`, `likes`, `comments`, `shares` |
| Pinterest | `impressions`, `likes`, `comments`, `saved`, `outbound_clicks` |

- Bluesky does not expose impression/view counts.
- Telegram channel posts do not currently expose per-post stats.
