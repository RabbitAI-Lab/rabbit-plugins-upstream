The list is fixed and always complete; if the live counts cannot be read, `counts_available` is `false` and the per-sport counts are omitted instead of failing the call.

Returns one stage from SofaScore's stage hierarchy: a season (Formula 1 2026), an event (a Grand Prix weekend, a NASCAR race, a rally, a cycling race), a session (practice, qualifying, sprint, race) or a cycling stage. The response has its type (`Season`, `Event`, `Practice`, `Qualifying`, `Qualifying part`, `Race`, `Sprint race`, `Sprint qualifying`, `Practice part`, `Stage`), status (`finished`, `notstarted`, `canceled`), start time, country, competition, parent stage (the season of an event, the event of a session), the winner once decided, and circuit, weather and race facts where published (laps, race distance, lap record, safety car, NASCAR cautions, rally special stages, cycling route). `info` fields are omitted when not published, never zero. A season has no status. Stage ids and competition ids are different id spaces. Returns 404 for an unknown stage id.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Numeric SofaScore stage id from stage-schedule, stage-seasons or stage-substages

### `sofascore_stage_categories`

- **HTTP:** `GET /sofascore/stage-categories`
- **What:** SofaScore motorsport and cycling categories and competitions. Lists the categories SofaScore keeps for a stage sport, each with its competitions. For `motorsport` that is the racing series (Formula 1, MotoGP, Moto2, Moto3, Superbike, NASCAR with its Cup, Truck and Xfinity competitions, WRC, Formula E, Indycar, DTM); for `cycling` it is Cycling Men and Cycling Women. Use a competition `id` with stage-seasons to list its seasons. Some categories exist without any competition (for example Motocross, Speedway, WEC) and return an empty `competitions` list. Motorsport and cycling are not available on the match-based endpoints (live-events, categories, scheduled-events); they use the stage endpoints. The `sport` enum accepts `motorsport` and `cycling`.
- **Params:** `sport` (string, **required**) — Stage sport key

### `sofascore_stage_driver_performance`

- **HTTP:** `GET /sofascore/stage-driver-performance`
- **What:** SofaScore motorsport race progress per driver. Returns every competitor's progress through a finished race or rally. For circuit races (Formula 1, MotoGP and similar) `laps` lists the position at the end of each lap, starting with lap 0 for the grid, plus the tyre compound and a `pit_stop` flag where published; the lap a driver retired has `retired` set and no position. For rallies `stage_positions` lists the overall position after each special stage. The response also repeats the stage itself. It is published for races and sprints of some series (verified for Formula 1, MotoGP and WRC) and not for practice, qualifying, NASCAR, cycling, events or seasons, which return 404. Returns 404 for an unknown id.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Numeric SofaScore stage id of a finished race, sprint or rally

### `sofascore_stage_featured`

Each event carries its competition, season name, parent season stage and country. Use an event `id` with stage-substages for its sessions or stages and stage-standings for results.

- **Params:** `sport` (string, **required**) — Stage sport key

### `sofascore_stage_schedule`

- **HTTP:** `GET /sofascore/stage-schedule`

Returns the events SofaScore lists for a stage sport around a UTC date: Grand Prix weekends, NASCAR race weekends, rallies and cycling races, each with its country, competition, every session start time (`session_start_timestamps`) and the session SofaScore highlights (`session`: the live, next or latest one). The list is not a strict one-day filter. It holds the events in progress on the date plus the next upcoming ones, and a quiet date still returns the next events; use `on_date`, which is true when a session of the event starts inside the requested UTC day, to separate them. Schedule rows carry no event status or winner: use `session.status`, or pass the event `id` to stage for the event detail and to stage-substages for its sessions. `date` must be a real calendar date written `YYYY-MM-DD`. An empty `stages` list is valid when nothing is in progress or scheduled nearby. The `sport` enum accepts `motorsport` and `cycling`.

A season `id` is a stage id: pass it to stage-substages for the race calendar and to stage-standings for the championship table. The season still in progress has no `end_timestamp`. Get the competition `id` from stage-categories (for example 40 for Formula 1, 17 for MotoGP, 18 for the NASCAR Cup Series, 9 for Cycling Men). Competition ids and stage ids are different id spaces, so a competition id passed to stage returns an unrelated stage. Returns 404 for an unknown competition id.

### `sofascore_stage_standings`

- **HTTP:** `GET /sofascore/stage-standings`

Rows are in upstream order. `position` is omitted for competitors who did not finish or set no time, and `gap` is `DNF` for a retirement. The parent session of a split qualifying has no standings; use the ids of its parts from stage-substages. Fields a classification does not publish are omitted. Returns 404 for an unknown id, a stage that has no results yet, or a kind of stage without that classification. The `type` enum accepts `competitor` and `team`.

- **What:** SofaScore children of a motorsport or cycling stage. Returns the children of a stage in upstream order. For a season it is the race calendar: every event with status (`finished`, `notstarted`, `canceled`), dates, round, circuit and winner. For an event it is the sessions: practices, qualifying, sprint qualifying, sprint and race for a Grand Prix, the numbered stages of a cycling race or rally. Qualifying and practice sessions list their `parts`, and the part ids carry the timing results (the parent session of a split qualifying has no standings of its own). Use a child `id` with stage for detail, stage-standings for its results and stage-driver-performance for race progress. A race, session or cycling stage has no children and returns 404, as does an unknown id.

Optional filters narrow the table: `team` (team ids), `nationality` (SofaScore nationality codes), `position` (`G`, `D`, `M`, `F`), `min_appearances` and `min_minutes`; several filters combine (AND) and several values of one filter are alternatives (OR). The team ids and nationality codes of a season come from tournament-statistics-info. A filter that matches nobody returns an empty `players` list. Other sports return no rows (404).

### `sofascore_tournament_rounds`

- **HTTP:** `GET /sofascore/tournament-rounds`
- **What:** SofaScore competition season rounds. Returns the rounds of a competition season and the current round.
