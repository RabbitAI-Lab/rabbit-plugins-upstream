## Publisher:

[engheng-art](https://clawhub.ai/user/engheng-art)

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

External users, content teams, marketing analysts, and developers use this skill to retrieve structured public Xiaohongshu data for keyword research, note and comment analysis, creator monitoring, competitor review, and downstream reporting.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Search keywords, Xiaohongshu URLs, request limits, and GUAIKEI_API_TOKEN are sent to the guaikei.com API.

Mitigation: Use the skill only when this data sharing is acceptable, protect the API token as a secret, and avoid submitting sensitive or unnecessary URLs.

Risk: Xiaohongshu URLs can include xsec_token values and task outputs may be written to local logs.

Mitigation: Treat xsec_token-bearing URLs and generated logs as sensitive, keep logs out of source control and shared backups, and delete logs when the research task is complete.

Risk: The skill is intended for public Xiaohongshu data and does not support private, hidden, or login-required content.

Mitigation: Limit use to public content research and do not use the results for unauthorized distribution or unlawful activity.
