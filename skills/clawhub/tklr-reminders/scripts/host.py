"""Every place this skill talks to its host agent. The only file a port edits.

The skill itself knows nothing about any agent. Reminders live in tklr, and
delivery is a plain shell command stored in the tklr workspace's `[alerts]`
section, which `tklr_alert_poller.py` runs on a schedule. The poller does not
call the host at all -- it runs the string it is given. That is what keeps the
host swappable: the agent is a client of this skill, never a component of it.

Three things do need a host, and all three live here:

  1. CHAT DISCOVERY -- what destinations can this machine reach, and what is
     the shell command that sends to one? `chat_list`, `chat_platforms`,
     `chat_target_ids`, `platform_targets`, `chat_targets`, `chat_send_command`.
  2. SCHEDULING -- run the dispatcher once a minute. `dispatcher_path`,
     `cron_job_present`, `create_cron_job`.
  3. HOST PATHS -- where a scheduled script must live, and where its log goes.
     `dispatcher_path`, `LOG_PATH`.

PORTING TO ANOTHER AGENT
Rewrite the bodies in this file; change nothing else. Each function's docstring
says what its replacement has to return, in terms of this skill rather than of
Hermes. Two of the three delivery routes the skill offers -- `himalaya` for
email and `notify-send` for the desktop -- are ordinary CLIs and are not host
calls, so they keep working untouched. Concretely, a port needs:

  * chat discovery: some way to enumerate destinations. If the host has no
    equivalent of `send --list`, `chat_list` can read a config file the user
    writes, and `chat_targets` can parse that instead. Returning nothing is
    valid and degrades honestly: the skill offers email and desktop only.
  * scheduling: `create_cron_job` can shell out to `crontab`, write a systemd
    timer, or do nothing and return a message telling the user what to add by
    hand. `dispatcher_path` exists only because Hermes' scheduler refuses any
    script outside `~/.hermes/scripts/`; a host without that restriction can
    return the skill's own copy and the deploy step becomes a no-op.

What a port must NOT do is reach past this file. If a new host call is needed,
add it here rather than at the point of use -- the value of one adapter is that
`grep -c hermes` outside this file stays at zero, so nobody has to discover the
seams by searching for them.

Nothing here exits the process. Failures raise HostError and each caller maps
it to its own reporting, because a missing host command means something
different to `setup` (fatal) than to `status` (worth reporting and carrying on).
