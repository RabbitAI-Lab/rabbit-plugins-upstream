"""Fast, agent-free tklr alert dispatcher.

Run every minute by the Hermes cron scheduler with --no-agent. No LLM, no
agent loop, stdlib only. Prints NOTHING on success (Hermes treats empty
stdout as silent); prints only what a human needs to act on.

This mirrors what tklr's own UI does in `Controller.execute_due_alerts()` --
read due alerts, run each one's command, delete the row -- with a one-minute
window instead of the UI's hard-coded six seconds, because we poll from cron
rather than from a running event loop.

    every minute:
      1. `tklr alerts` -- makes tklr recompute today's Alerts rows
      2. reap rows that are more than MAX_LATE behind (see below)
      3. read rows whose trigger_datetime is now or earlier
      4. run each row's alert_command (shlex.split + subprocess, no shell)
      5. delete each row that was delivered
      6. append a line to the delivery log ($TKLR_ALERTS_LOG)

There is no routing table and no send ledger. Delivery is defined entirely by
the `[alerts]` section of the tklr workspace's config.toml: one lowercase
letter per (person, channel), whose command is the delivery. tklr renders
{name}, {when}, {start}, {time}, {location}, {description} into the stored
command, so the message text is config, not code.

Per-destination state is not needed either: tklr writes one Alerts row per
(offset x letter), so a row *is* a single delivery. Deleting the row it just
sent gives exact once-only semantics, and a failed row simply stays for the
next run while its siblings are already gone.

A retry is bounded by MAX_LATE (default 60 minutes, $TKLR_ALERTS_MAX_LATE to
change). Past that the row is reaped and reported once, never retried again.
Both halves of that matter. Without the reaper, a row whose command keeps
failing -- a channel letter that was removed, a send binary that is broken --
is retried every minute forever, spawning a subprocess each time and filling
the log. And without the *floor* on what counts as due, every alert missed
while this machine was off fires in a single burst when it comes back, which
for a day-long outage means a day of reminders at once. An alert an hour late
is not worth delivering; it is worth telling someone it was missed.

Two database accesses are deliberate workarounds for missing tklr commands,
and are the only ones in this skill:
  * DELETE a delivered row -- tklr has no CLI for `mark_alert_executed()`.
    Safe because populate_alerts() only regenerates rows with
    trigger_datetime >= now, so a past-due row is never recreated.
  * Read due rows, and clear two derived-state cache keys to work around
    tklr's stale-cache bug (see --heal).

Usage:
  tklr_alert_poller.py             dispatch due alerts
  tklr_alert_poller.py --heal      force tklr to rebuild derived tables first
  tklr_alert_poller.py --verbose   report what was seen even when nothing was
                                   due -- use this when verifying setup, because
                                   silence alone does NOT mean "delivered"
  tklr_alert_poller.py --check     REPORT ONLY. Sends nothing, deletes nothing,
                                   rebuilds nothing. This is what `status` runs,
                                   so inspecting a pending alert cannot consume
                                   it -- and so a passing check proves CRON
                                   delivered, not that the check itself did.
