"""Add, change, or list tklr alert channel letters — safely.

Editing the `[alerts]` section by hand has three traps. This script handles all
of them so callers never have to:

  1. The section normally exists but holds only comments, so a naive
     "append after [alerts]" or "create the section" both go wrong.
  2. An apostrophe anywhere in a command makes tklr rewrite the file as invalid
     TOML, and the command after that discards the whole section — the channel
     silently disappears two tklr runs later.
  3. Whether the letter survived can only be established by running tklr twice
     and re-reading the file, because erasure takes two runs.

Usage
  set_alert_channel.py --list
  set_alert_channel.py --mail-accounts        # himalaya account -> From: address
  set_alert_channel.py r '<any shell command that sends a message>'
  set_alert_channel.py --remove r
  set_alert_channel.py --home ~/.config/tklr r '<command>'

A letter's value is a plain shell command, so the channel can be anything this
machine can send with. The only host-specific part is validating a chat target
against what the machine can reach, which goes through host.py.

Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 rejected/failed, 2 usage error.
