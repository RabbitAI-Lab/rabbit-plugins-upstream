description: Delegate coding, repository analysis, file edits, test runs, or code review to the local Codex CLI without embedding an OpenAI API key. This skill was created to work with ChatGPT/Codex enterprise accounts that may not have the same level of API access. Invokes codex exec with existing ChatGPT/Codex CLI authentication and returns Codex's final output.

# Codex Delegate

Invoke this skill only with an **explicit command** from the user, such as `@codex-delegate` or `/codex-delegate`, or when the user directly asks to delegate a **specific coding task** (e.g., "use Codex to refactor this file," "ask Codex to review this PR"). Do NOT auto-trigger on casual mentions of "Codex" or "delegate" in general conversation, or on non-coding tasks. Do NOT auto-trigger on casual mentions of "Codex" or "delegate" in general conversation. This skill hands coding/repository tasks to the local Codex CLI and is meant for local, trusted operator setups where `codex` is already installed and signed in.

## Preconditions

- `codex` is installed on `PATH`.
- Codex CLI has already been authenticated by the operator, preferably with ChatGPT sign-in. Do not ask the user for an API key.
- Run inside the target repository or pass `--cwd`.
- OpenClaw must allow this agent to use `exec` for the wrapper script.

If Codex is not authenticated, tell the operator to run `codex` or `codex login` once and complete the ChatGPT browser login. Do not request, print, copy, or inspect `~/.codex/auth.json`.

## Wrapper

Prefer the bundled wrapper:

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/codex-delegate.sh --cwd /path/to/repo --prompt "summarize the repository and list the riskiest files"
```

For file creation or edits:

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/codex-delegate.sh \
  --cwd /path/to/repo \
  --sandbox workspace-write \
  --prompt "Create docs/architecture.md explaining the current service layout."
```

For machine-readable event logs while still returning the final Codex answer:

```bash
{baseDir}/scripts/codex-delegate.sh \
  --cwd /path/to/repo \
  --sandbox workspace-write \
  --json-log .openclaw/codex-runs/last.jsonl \
  --output .openclaw/codex-runs/last.md \
  --prompt "Review the auth changes and fix any failing tests."
```

To pass CLI-style context:

```bash
npm test 2>&1 | {baseDir}/scripts/codex-delegate.sh \
  --cwd /path/to/repo \
  --sandbox workspace-write \
  --prompt "Summarize the failing tests and make the smallest safe fix."
```

Use `--prompt-file path` when a generated prompt is already on disk. Use `--stdin-file path` when another tool wrote context to a file.

## Delegation Workflow

1. Restate the exact Codex task in one compact prompt.
2. Choose the narrowest sandbox:
   - `read-only` for analysis, review, summaries, planning.
   - `workspace-write` for creating or editing files in the repo.
   - `danger-full-access` only on an isolated machine/container with explicit operator approval.
3. Run the wrapper from the repository root or with `--cwd`.
4. Return Codex's final answer to the user.
5. If edits were allowed, inspect `git diff --stat` and relevant diffs before claiming files were changed.

## Safety Rules

- Never pass `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY`, or raw tokens to Codex. The wrapper unsets API-key env vars before invoking `codex exec`.
- Never read, reveal, summarize, or copy `~/.codex/auth.json`.
- Do not run this skill from public or untrusted chat channels.
- Do not give Codex secrets, credentials, private keys, or production data unless the operator explicitly approved that exact data flow.
- Prefer an isolated checkout or git worktree for write tasks.
- Treat Codex output as another agent's report; verify important claims locally.

## Failure Handling

- `codex: command not found`: ask the operator to install Codex CLI.
- Authentication failure: ask the operator to run `codex login` with ChatGPT sign-in, then retry.
- Git repo error: run in a git repository, or use `--skip-git-repo-check` only for a deliberately isolated scratch workspace.
- Permission error on edits: retry with `--sandbox workspace-write` only if file changes are intended.
