# Short-Form Market Research Brain

Your AI agent's brain for short-form video market research, powered by the [Virlo API](https://dev.virlo.ai).

## What This Skill Does

Gives your OpenClaw agent deep expertise in social media market research across TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. Everything runs through the unified **Content Research Agents API** (`POST /v1/agents`): set `is_recurring: false` for a one-shot niche search, or `is_recurring: true` for recurring monitoring: one resource, one set of read paths.

- **Niche Research**: Search any topic and get AI-generated intelligence reports covering trends, creators, platform dynamics, sentiment, and viral patterns
- **Creator Discovery**: Find rising creators who outperform their follower count, analyze any creator's profile and engagement metrics
- **Trend Tracking**: Pop culture & News show what people are talking about (news and pop culture, by region); Content Trends show the video formats creators are copying right now. Drill into hashtag performance
- **Ad Intelligence**: See what Meta ads are running for any topic or niche
- **Automated Monitoring**: Set up recurring agents that run daily, weekly, or monthly. Autopilot, on by default, keeps tuning their keywords and never removes the ones you set

> The older `/v1/orbit` and `/v1/comet` endpoints are **deprecated**. They still respond today, but don't build on them: migrate to `/v1/agents` (IDs are interchangeable).

## Install

```bash
clawhub install short-form-market-research-brain
```

## Setup

1. Get a Virlo API key at [dev.virlo.ai/dashboard](https://dev.virlo.ai/dashboard)
2. Add funds to your prepaid balance at [dev.virlo.ai/dashboard/billing](https://dev.virlo.ai/dashboard/billing) (the page shows the minimum). No subscriptions, and the balance never expires
3. Provide the key as the `VIRLO_API_KEY` environment variable. In `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json5
{
  skills: {
    entries: {
      "short-form-market-research-brain": {
        env: { VIRLO_API_KEY: "virlo_tkn_YOUR_KEY" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The skill declares `VIRLO_API_KEY` as a required env var, so OpenClaw keeps it hidden until the key is configured: once set, it activates automatically.
