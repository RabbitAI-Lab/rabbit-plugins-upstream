name: linux-security-guardian
description: Autonomous multi-client Linux server security management via SSH MCP. Runs full audit at 1 AM IST nightly via cron. Iterates over all clients and their server fleets. Covers system hardening, CVE scanning (CISA KEV + OSV.dev + NVD API), user auditing, SSH config (incl. weak ciphers/MACs/Kex), firewall rules, running services, file permissions, log analysis, SSL certs, kernel parameters (incl. BPF restrictions), Docker daemon security defaults (userns-remap, no-new-privileges, seccomp), fail2ban auto-install, unattended-upgrades auto-enable, CIS benchmark scoring, systemd sandbox analysis, AppArmor/SELinux audit, and swap encryption check. Non-breaking actions auto-applied. Critical patches and network/firewall changes require owner confirmation. Report sent per-server and per-client via email plugin/skill (not bundled). All owner-specific config lives in core-extra/config/ — no hardcoded names, domains, or emails.

# Linux Security Guardian

## ⚡ SSH MCP — REQUIRED DEPENDENCY

> **SSH MCP is a hard dependency. The agent MUST have SSH MCP tools available to operate.**
> No local/legacy fallback. All operations go through SSH MCP.

### Prerequisite

```yaml
# SSH MCP server must be running and accessible
dependency: ssh_mcp
status: required    # if unavailable → ABORT, alert owner
```

### Server Profile Config

Each target server needs a saved connection in SSH MCP database. Configure in `SERVER_PROFILE.md`:

```yaml
ssh_mcp:
  connection_id: "<id-name-or-alias-from-ssh-conn-list>"   # Saved connection ID, Name, or Alias
  # OR inline config:
  # host: "<server-ip>"
  # port: 22
  # username: "<user>"
  # key_path: "</path/to/key>"
```

### Audit Modules

All 26 modules execute commands via SSH MCP. Each module file lists commands that get wrapped with `ssh_exec(op="run", sessionId, command)`:

```
module command → ssh_exec(op="run", sessionId, command="module command")
              → ssh_exec(op="logs", commandId=cmdId)
              → parse output
```

### CVE Scan

The external CVE scan runs locally (on the guardian host) using curl to CISA KEV, OSV.dev, and NVD API.
Usage requires `--client` and `--server` to write results to per-server paths:

```bash
bash cve/cve-scan.sh --client "client-1" --server "server-01"

# Writes results to:
#   cve/<client>/<server>/scan-results/YYYY-MM-DD.md
#   cve/<client>/<server>/advisories/<CVE-ID>.md
```

Steps:
```bash
# 1. SSH MCP: ssh_exec(op="run", sessionId, command="dpkg-query -W ...") → save locally
# 2. Read from cve/<client>/<server>/scan-results/installed-packages.txt
# 3. curl CISA KEV → filter Linux entries → write advisories
# 4. curl POST OSV.dev batch → match packages → write advisories
# 5. curl NVD API (optional) → cross-check → write advisories
```

## Core-Extra Config System

All owner-specific data lives in `core-extra/config/` — **never hardcoded** in hooks or modules.

### Profile
| File | Contains | Fields |
|------|----------|--------|
| `core-extra/config/profile.md` | Owner identity + domain + email | `Owner.name`, `Domain.primary`, `Email.noreply` |

### How Agents Use It
```
At session start → load core-extra/config/profile.md
→ Owner.name  → used in SOUL.md [WORKSPACE OWNER]
→ Email.noreply → used as from: in mail-sender.md
→ Domain.primary → used in config generation

To change: edit core-extra/config/profile.md only.
```

### Rule
- NO hardcoded names, domains, or emails in hooks/, modules/, or root files
- All personal/owner data comes from `core-extra/config/profile.md`
- The core-extra directory is part of the skill (published to ClawHub with placeholders)
- Owner fills profile.md ONCE after install

---

## Multi-Client Architecture

The guardian manages **multiple clients**, each with their own server fleet.
SERVER_PROFILE.md defines `## Client:` sections. The audit iterates ALL.

```
SERVER_PROFILE.md
├── ## Client: client-1 (7 servers)
│   ├── server-01
│   ├── server-02
│   └── ... server-07
├── ## Client: client-2 (N servers) ← add as needed
│   └── ...
└── ## Client: [NEXT-CLIENT]
```

All paths use `<client>/<server>/` prefix:
- Findings: `audit/results/<client>/<server>/<severity>/`
- Actions:  `actions/<client>/<server>/auto-done/`
- CVEs:     `cve/<client>/<server>/advisories/`
- Reports:  `reports/<client>/<server>/daily/`

---

## Purpose

Agent manages complete Linux server security autonomously via SSH MCP.
Every night at 1 AM IST:
- Iterates all clients → all servers
- Full security audit runs via SSH MCP
- CVEs scanned against installed packages
- Auto-fixes applied for safe issues
- Critical issues queued for owner confirmation
- Per-server, per-client, and master email reports delivered

---

## Action Decision Matrix

The most important thing — what agent does vs what it asks first:

| Finding Type | CVSS / Severity | Action |
|---|---|---|
| CVE — Critical | ≥ 9.0 | EMAIL ALERT immediately + queue for confirm |
| CVE — High | 7.0–8.9 | Queue for confirm + include in report |
| CVE — Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Include in report + advisory |
| CVE — Low | < 4.0 | Info in report only |
| CVE — KEV (CISA) | any | **Treated as CRITICAL** — immediate alert + confirm within due date |
| CVE — KEV + Ransomware | any | **🔥 HIGHEST PRIORITY** — immediate alert, confirm ASAP |
| Kernel update available | any | Confirm required before patch |
| Security-only pkg update | any | Confirm required |
| SSH: PermitRootLogin yes | critical | Alert + confirm to fix |
| SSH: PasswordAuth yes | high | Alert + confirm to fix |
| SSH: Port 22 | medium | Advisory only |
| Empty password account | critical | AUTO-LOCK immediately |
| Unknown root-uid account | critical | Alert + confirm to lock |
| Inactive account > 90d | medium | Alert + confirm to lock |
| World-writable /tmp | medium | AUTO-FIX chmod |
| World-writable system dir | high | Alert + confirm to fix |
| Unexpected SUID binary | high | Alert only (owner decides) |
| Failed login spike > 20/hr | high | Alert immediately |
| New unknown cron job | high | Alert immediately |
| Firewall rule change needed | any | CONFIRM REQUIRED always |
| Open unexpected port | high | Alert + confirm to close |
| Service: unnecessary running | medium | Alert + confirm to stop |
| SSL cert expiring < 30d | warning | Alert |
| SSL cert expired | critical | Alert immediately |
| Disk > 85% full | warning | Alert |
| Disk > 95% full | critical | Alert immediately |
| Auditd not running | high | AUTO-START + alert |
| fail2ban not running | high | AUTO-START + alert |
| Log file suspicious entry | high | Alert with extract |

## Finding Severity Levels

| Level | Color | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CRITICAL` | 🔴 | Immediate risk, action required now |
| `HIGH` | 🟠 | Significant risk, fix this week |
| `MEDIUM` | 🟡 | Moderate risk, fix this month |
| `LOW` | 🔵 | Minor issue, fix when possible |
| `INFO` | ⚪ | Informational, no action needed |
| `PASS` | 🟢 | Check passed, all good |

---

## Confirmation Flow

When owner confirmation is needed:

```
Finding detected (requires confirm) on <client>/<server>
    ↓
Write to actions/<client>/<server>/pending-confirm/<client>-<server>-<id>-<slug>.md
    ↓
Include in email report under "NEEDS YOUR DECISION" with <client>/<server> context
    ↓
Owner replies with: APPROVE <id> / DENY <id> / SKIP <id>
(Full ID format: <client>-<server>-<type>-<NNN>, e.g. client-1-server-01-ACT-20260529-001)
    ↓
Search all actions/*/*/pending-confirm/ for the ID
    ↓
APPROVE → agent connects to <client>/<server> via SSH MCP → executes action → logs to history/
DENY    → action skipped, noted
SKIP    → deferred to next audit
```

## Email Report Structure

Reports are sent per-server, per-client (summary), and master. All via email plugin/skill.

## Security Score Formula

```
score = 100
score -= (critical_count × 20)
score -= (high_count × 10)
score -= (medium_count × 3)
score -= (low_count × 1)
score = max(0, score)

Grade: 90-100 = A | 75-89 = B | 60-74 = C | < 60 = F
