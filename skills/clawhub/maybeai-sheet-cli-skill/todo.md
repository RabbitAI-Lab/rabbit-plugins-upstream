# maybeai-sheet-skill TODO

## Done

- [x] Shrink `SKILL.md` to skill entry (routing, playbooks, rules)
- [x] Split long API docs into `references/`
- [x] CLI-first execution contract
- [x] Remove `scripts/*.sh` curl examples — replaced by `references/cli-commands.md`
- [x] Add `scripts/sync_cli_release.py` hook to sync skill version after CLI PyPI publish

## P1

- [ ] Add CLI wrappers for uncovered high-value endpoints: `workbook_profile`, `lineage_trace`, SQL compile/write, export
- [ ] Keep command examples in `references/cli-commands.md` in sync with CLI repo releases

## P2

- [ ] Review frontmatter extension fields for runtime necessity
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate endpoint docs across reference files
