# Agent Slim

A reversible "checkup + diet" for agents that have been in use for a while: find what actually occupies every-turn context, move low-frequency material into on-demand storage, and prove key behaviour still works.

## Quick start (5 minutes)

1. Scope it: which agent, which skills, what must not be touched.
2. Read-only audit: `python3 scripts/agent_slim.py audit --json` (auto-detects CODEX_HOME, or pass `--home`). Nothing is modified.
3. Build a plan: `python3 scripts/agent_slim.py plan --audit audit.json`. Items without hash or confirmation evidence stay pending.
4. Reversible apply: `apply` is dry-run by default; `--apply` moves allowlisted files into a transaction directory outside the home, with manifest, SHA-256 and restore script.
5. Verify and restore: `verify` checks preserved files, references, frontmatter and optional test prompts; `restore --apply` is idempotent and stops on conflicts.

## Three layers

- **Hot** — resident rules, descriptions and tool docs. Shrinking them can cut per-turn tokens.
- **Warm** — skill bodies and references loaded only on trigger. Token savings count only when loading is actually avoided.
- **Cold** — archives, backups, old sessions. Disk savings only; never reported as token savings.

## Safety

Dry-run by default; three move actions only (quarantine redundant backup, archive verified old session, quarantine confirmed low-frequency skill file). No deletion, no VACUUM, no secret/provider changes, no upload of company data. Conflicts stop the run and never overwrite user content.

## Status

v0.1.2 is published on GitHub, SkillHub and ClawHub. Codex is the first host with an audit/plan/apply/verify/restore implementation verified on a synthetic aging fixture; real-host trigger regression is still `PARTIAL` until executable test prompts are supplied. Other agents are interface-only. Install from GitHub Releases, `skillhub install agent-slim --namespace user_43faedd6`, or `clawhub install agent-slim`.
