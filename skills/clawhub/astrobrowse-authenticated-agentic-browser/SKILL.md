# AstroBrowse - Authenticated Agentic Browser

## Freshness
Last updated: `2026-08-11`.

If the current date is more than 7 days after the last updated date, reinstall this skill from skills.sh or ClawHub before relying on endpoints, schemas, setup steps, or examples.

## What This Tool Does
Give your AI agent access to the websites and accounts you choose, without ever handing over your passwords. AstroBrowse runs a real, logged-in web browser on your behalf so your agent can work inside the tools you already use: social media, CRMs, ERPs, dashboards, and any SaaS platform or website, including the many that have no API. Save a login once and your agent can resume that session to post content, pull reports, update records, fill forms, download files, and complete multi-step tasks, all in a fresh, single-use browser that is wiped clean when the job is done. If a site ever needs a human touch, like a sign-in confirmation or a quick verification step, AstroBrowse hands you a link to step in for a moment and then lets your agent carry on. You stay in control of which accounts are connected and what the agent is allowed to visit.

## Product Instructions
### AstroBrowse - Authenticated Agentic Browser

Operate a real, logged-in web browser on the user's behalf. The user saves their logins once; you resume those sessions to work inside their accounts without ever seeing a password. Every session is single-use and isolated, and is wiped when you close it.

Full setup guide (Tailscale network egress, enabling the tool, saving a login): https://www.agentpmt.com/docs/tool-specific/astrobrowse

#### Workflow
1. `list_accounts` to see the user's saved logins.
2. `initialize_browser` with a stable `idempotency_key` (required, so a retry never starts a second session) plus `account_id` to resume a saved login, or omit `account_id` for a general-browsing session when the user's policy allows it. Returns a `browser_session_id`.
3. Operate the page with `run_steps`, `extract_page`, `screenshot`, `start_recording` / `stop_recording`, `upload_file`, and `list_downloads` / `download_file`.
4. If a site needs a human (CAPTCHA, MFA, or an unusual login), call `request_user_takeover` then poll `wait_for_takeover`. The user steps in on the live session.
5. Always `close_browser` when finished.

`get_policy` tells you whether general browsing is allowed (`saved_only` | `open` | `open_with_allowlist`). Only the user can change the policy, from their dashboard; there is no agent action to change it.

#### Actions
- `list_accounts` — list saved logins. Call this first.
- `get_policy` — read the browsing policy. It is set only by the user from their dashboard.
- `initialize_browser` — required `idempotency_key`; optional `account_id`, `initial_url`, `region`. Omit `account_id` for a general-browsing session only when the user has enabled it.
- `run_steps` (`browser_session_id`, `steps[]`) — execute 1 to 20 browser steps in one request; an empty steps list is invalid. Supported step actions are `goto`, `click`, `fill`, `press`, `select`, `wait_for_load_state`, `wait_for_selector`, `extract_text`, `extract_html`, and `screenshot`. Each step accepts only the fields defined by the tool schema, such as `selector`, `text`, `url`, `key`, `value`, and `timeout_ms` (500 to 60000). Caller-supplied JavaScript and script fields are not supported. The 20-step allowance resets for each `run_steps` request; it is not a per-session quota. Screenshot steps save PNGs to File Manager and return `artifact.file_id` plus a fresh `artifact.signed_url`, never inline image base64.
- `extract_page` (`browser_session_id`, `selector?`, `include_html?`) — return visible text or capped HTML.
- `screenshot` (`browser_session_id`) — save a PNG to File Manager and return `artifact.file_id` plus a fresh seven-day `artifact.signed_url`. Raw image base64 is not returned inline.
- `upload_file` (`browser_session_id`, `selector`, `file_ids[]`) — attach File Manager files to a visible `<input type=file>`. Reveal the input with supported `run_steps` actions first.
- `list_downloads` / `download_file` (`browser_session_id`, `download_name?`) — list files the page downloaded and persist one to File Manager.
- `start_recording` (`show_cursor?`) / `stop_recording` — save an MP4 of the session to File Manager. Stop recording before closing.
- `request_user_takeover` (`reason`) / `wait_for_takeover` — hand the live session to the human, then poll for status.
- `status` — return sanitized live status without cookies or credentials.
- `close_browser` — release and wipe the session. Always call when done. Anonymous sessions are discarded because they have no saved login to persist.

#### Safety and execution rules
- Do not attempt to execute JavaScript, inject scripts, access browser internals, or bypass the supported action grammar.
- Each `run_steps` request must contain 1 to 20 steps. Split longer workflows across requests and re-check page state between requests.
- Prefer selectors tied to stable labels, roles, names, or IDs. Use extraction and screenshots to confirm state before consequential actions.
- Use human takeover for CAPTCHA, MFA, login confirmation, or any action that requires the user's judgment.
- Artifact actions (`screenshot`, `download_file`, `stop_recording`, `upload_file`) run inside a workflow with budget context.
- Credentials are never exposed to the agent.
- Sessions are single-use and isolated; closing wipes them.

## Live Schema And Examples
Use the compact schema above for ordinary calls. Before a new production integration, or whenever parameters, enum values, nested objects, outputs, or examples are unclear, fetch live details first.

- Exact schema: call `agentpmt-tool-search-and-execution` with `action: "get_schema"`, and `tool_id: "astrobrowse-authenticated-agentic-browser"`.
- Detailed examples: call `agentpmt-tool-search-and-execution` with `action: "get_instructions"` and `tool_id: "astrobrowse-authenticated-agentic-browser"`, or call this product with `action: "get_instructions"` when the product tool is already selected.
- Treat returned live schema and instructions as more specific than this generated summary.

MCP schema lookup through the main AgentPMT MCP server:

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "AgentPMT-Tool-Search-and-Execution",
    "arguments": {
      "action": "get_schema",
      "tool_id": "astrobrowse-authenticated-agentic-browser"
    }
  }
}
```

For live examples, keep the same MCP tool and use these arguments:

```json
{
  "action": "get_instructions",
  "tool_id": "astrobrowse-authenticated-agentic-browser"
}
```

Authenticated AgentPMT REST schema lookup body:

## Response Handling
- Treat the returned JSON as the source of truth for this tool call.
- If the response includes warnings or correction targets, apply them before retrying.
- If the response includes a `passed` or success-style boolean, use it as the workflow gate.
- If validation fails or the response shape is unclear, call `get_schema` or `get_instructions` before retrying.
- If `close_browser` fails, preserve the request parameters and retry only after fixing schema, auth, or payment errors.

## Security
- Do not place account secrets, wallet private keys, mnemonics, signatures, or payment headers in prompts or logs.
- Keep tool inputs scoped to the minimum content needed for the task.
- Use the setup skills for credential handling; this product skill only defines product-specific behavior.
