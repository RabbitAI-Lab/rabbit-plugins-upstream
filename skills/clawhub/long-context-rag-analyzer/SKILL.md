## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Document Intake & Preprocessing

**Step 1.1: Document Classification**

Classify incoming documents by type, structure, and processing priority.

**Document Taxonomy:**

| Category | Examples | Structure | Processing Priority |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Financial Report | Annual report, 10-K, earnings transcript | Semi-structured, tables | CRITICAL |
| Legal Contract | Insurance policy, loan agreement | Highly structured, dense | HIGH |
| Research Paper | Academic paper, market study | Well-structured, citations | MEDIUM |
| Internal Memo | Meeting notes, internal email | Unstructured | LOW |
| Regulatory Filing | CBIRC submission, SEC filing | Structured, tabular | CRITICAL |

**Step 1.2: Metadata Extraction**

Extract key metadata to enable filtering and ranking.

**Required metadata:**
- Document ID, title, date, source
- Entity mentions (companies, people, products)
- Key dates (report period, deadlines, event dates)
- Sentiment/tone indicators
- Page count, token count (estimated)

**For financial reports specifically:**
- Company name, ticker, fiscal period
- Revenue, net income, key ratios (extracted if available)
- Auditor, filing date
- Related entities (subsidiaries, parent companies)

---

### Phase 2 — Chunking Strategy Selection

**Step 2.1: Choose Chunking Approach**

Different document types require different chunking strategies. Select based on:

```
Chunking Strategy Matrix:

| Strategy | Best For | Chunk Size | Overlap | Preserves |
|----------|----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| Fixed-size | Homogeneous content (logs, tickets) | 512-1024 tokens | 50-100 tokens | Speed |
| Semantic | Paragraph-level meaning | 512-1500 tokens | 10-20% | Coherence |
| Document-structure | Reports, contracts, papers | By section/chapter | 100-200 tokens | Structure |
| Recursive | Nested content | Adaptive 256-1024 | 15% | Hierarchy |
| Agentic | Mixed content types | Dynamic | Context-aware | Intent |

For financial reports: RECOMMEND → Semantic + Document-structure hybrid
For legal contracts: RECOMMEND → Recursive with section boundaries
For research papers: RECOMMEND → Document-structure by section + citation graph
```

**Step 2.2: Calculate Optimal Chunk Size**

```python
# Chunk size calculator
def calculate_optimal_chunk_size(document_tokens, query_pattern):
    # Estimate based on query complexity
    if "detailed analysis" in query_pattern or "deep dive" in query_pattern:
        chunk_size = 1500  # Larger chunks for complex queries
    elif "comparison" in query_pattern or "summary" in query_pattern:
        chunk_size = 2048  # Section-level for comparative analysis
    elif "specific fact" in query_pattern or "look up" in query_pattern:
        chunk_size = 256   # Small chunks for precise retrieval
    else:
        chunk_size = 768  # Default
    
    overlap = int(chunk_size * 0.15)  # 15% overlap
    return chunk_size, overlap
```

---

### Phase 3 — Indexing & Retrieval

**Step 3.1: Hybrid Search Setup**

Combine vector similarity search with keyword (BM25) search for optimal retrieval.

**Hybrid Search Architecture:**

```
Query → [Vector Search (cosine similarity)] ←→ [BM25 Keyword Search]
              ↓                                    ↓
        Top-K semantic results              Top-K keyword results
              ↓                                    ↓
        Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) → Final ranked results
```

**Configuration for different use cases:**

```python
# China financial report RAG — Hybrid config
HYBRID_CONFIG = {
    "vector": {
        "model": "text-embedding-3-large",  # 3072 dim for high quality
        "dimension": 3072,
        "召回率_top_k": 20,
        "similarity_threshold": 0.75
    },
    "keyword": {
        "algorithm": "BM25",
        "k1": 1.5,
        "b": 0.75,
        "召回率_top_k": 20
    },
    "fusion": {
        "method": "RRF",  # Reciprocal Rank Fusion
        "rrf_k": 60  # Standard RRF parameter
    },
    "rerank": {
        "model": "cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12v2",
        "top_n": 5  # Final reranked results
    }
}
```

**Step 3.2: Retrieval Quality Evaluation**

Evaluate the RAG pipeline before deploying.

**Metrics to measure:**

| Metric | What it measures | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Precision@K | % of retrieved docs relevant | > 0.85 |
| Recall@K | % of relevant docs retrieved | > 0.80 |
| MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank) | Rank of first relevant doc | > 0.70 |
| NDCG@K | Ranking quality weighted by relevance | > 0.75 |
| Context Precision | % of context chunks actually used | > 0.60 |
| Hallucination Rate | Factual errors per 1000 tokens | < 0.05 |

**Example evaluation:**

```
## RAG Pipeline Evaluation Report

Test Set: 50 financial Q&A pairs from annual reports
Index: 120 documents (5 years × 24 companies)
Chunk size: 1024 tokens, 15% overlap

### Retrieval Metrics
- Precision@5: 0.89 ✅
- Recall@10: 0.82 ✅
- MRR: 0.76 ✅
- NDCG@5: 0.81 ✅

### Quality Issues Identified
❌ Table data losing structure when chunked — fix: preserve tables as JSON chunks
❌ Chinese financial terms inconsistently embedded — fix: add bilingual glossary
⚠️ Long queries (>500 tokens) retrieving irrelevant context — fix: query compression

### Action Plan
1. [HIGH] Implement table-aware chunking for financial tables
2. [MEDIUM] Add financial terminology glossary to embedding model
3. [LOW] Add query compression预处理 layer
```

---

### Phase 4 — Multi-Document Reasoning

**Step 4.1: Cross-Document Synthesis**

When a query spans multiple documents (e.g., "compare 5-year revenue trends across 3 insurers"), synthesize findings across documents.

**Synthesis Strategy:**

```
1. Retrieve top-K chunks from each document
2. Group by document and dimension (revenue, cost, risk, etc.)
3. For each dimension, generate a summary finding
4. Cross-reference findings — flag contradictions
5. Generate comparative analysis with supporting citations
6. Format as structured report with confidence scores
```

**Step 4.2: Financial Report Pipeline (Specialized)**

Tailored workflow for analyzing financial reports (annual reports, 10-Ks, CBIRC filings).

**Pipeline:**

```
1. PDF Ingestion → Structured Text + Tables
2. Page-level chunking (preserve table structure)
3. Entity extraction: company names, financial metrics, dates
4. Section classification: 业务回顾, 财务报表, 风险因素, 治理结构
5. Index with financial metadata filters
6. Query interface: natural language → structured answer + source citations
```

**Example query:**
> "Compare 国寿, 平安, 太保's solvency margin ratios over the past 3 years, and identify which company showed the most improvement."

**Output:**
```
## Solvency Margin Comparison: 国寿 vs 平安 vs 太保 (2023-2025)

| Company | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | Change | Rating |
|---------|------|------|------|--------|--------|
| 国寿 | 218% | 224% | 231% | +13pp ⬆️ | Strong |
| 平安 | 195% | 201% | 208% | +13pp ⬆️ | Adequate |
| 太保 | 189% | 197% | 205% | +16pp ⬆️ | Adequate |

### Key Findings
1. **太保 showed the strongest improvement** (+16pp) driven by capital raise
2. **国寿 maintains the highest absolute level** (231%), well above CBIRC minimum
3. **平安 is most consistent** — steady improvement trajectory
4. **Risk:** All three face pressure from interest rate environment in Q2 2026

Sources: 国寿 2025 Annual Report p.42, 平安 2025 Annual Report p.38, 太保 2025 Annual Report p.35
Confidence: 92%

1. Extract all liability exclusions
2. Find clauses with financial thresholds > ¥500K
3. Identify auto-renewal and termination clauses
4. Compare against a standard template

Can I do this with RAG?
```

**Output:**
```
## Contract Analysis — RAG-Enhanced Review

### Document: [Group Insurance Contract v3.2]
- Pages: 200 (~280K tokens)
- Processing: Full document upload (2M context can handle directly)
- Chunking: Section-preserving (chapter-level) + clause-level for key sections

### Key Findings

**1. Liability Exclusions (12 found)**
| Clause ID | Exclusion Type | Page | Severity |
|-----------|---------------|------|----------|
| EX-003 | Pre-existing conditions | p.24 | HIGH |
| EX-007 | Natural disaster cap | p.31 | MEDIUM |
| EX-011 | War/nuclear risk | p.45 | STANDARD |

**2. Financial Thresholds > ¥500K (4 found)**
| Clause | Threshold | Type | Page |
|--------|-----------|------|------|
| CL-015 | ¥2M | Claim limit | p.52 |
| CL-022 | ¥800K | Deductible | p.63 |
| CL-031 | ¥5M | Annual aggregate | p.71 |

**3. Auto-Renewal & Termination Clauses**
- Auto-renewal: p.89 — 30-day notice to cancel, otherwise auto-renew
- Termination for non-payment: p.91 — Policy lapses after 30 days past due
- CBIRC-mandated cooling period: p.93 — 15-day free look period ✅

**4. Comparison vs. Standard Template**
Deviations from standard CBIRC group insurance template:
- ⚠️ Liability cap 15% lower than standard
- ⚠️ Deductible 20% higher than standard  
- ✅ 5 additional exclusions not in standard (review for reasonableness)
- ✅ Cooling period compliant with CBIRC requirements

### Recommended Actions
1. [URGENT] Renegotiate CL-015 claim limit upward
2. [HIGH] Add actuarial justification memo for non-standard exclusions
3. [MEDIUM] Standardize auto-renewal notice period to 45 days (recommended)
```

---

## Advanced: Context Window Optimization

When the document exceeds the model's context window (even with 2M tokens):

**Tiered retrieval strategy:**

```
Level 1 — Global overview: Summarize entire corpus (50-100 chunks → 1 summary)
Level 2 — Topic-level: Identify relevant sections (~20 chunks → section summaries)
Level 3 — Granular: Retrieve specific chunks for final synthesis (~5 chunks → answer)
```

**For Chinese documents, special considerations:**
- Use bilingual or Chinese-specialized embedding models
- Handle mixed Chinese/English terminology consistently
- Preserve financial terminology precision (exact translation of regulatory terms)
- Check CBIRC-specific glossaries for regulatory documents

---

## Notes & Best Practices

1. **Chunking is 80% of RAG quality.** Invest time in domain-specific chunking strategies rather than defaulting to fixed-size chunks.
2. **Context window ≠ useful context.** A model that can read 2M tokens still performs better when retrieval is precise. Don't skip the retrieval optimization layer.
3. **Chinese financial documents:** Annual reports in Chinese often contain dense tabular data and regulatory citations. Use table-aware chunking and add CBIRC/CIRC glossary terms to your embedding model.
4. **Hallucination guardrails:** Always require citations (page numbers, section refs) in RAG outputs for financial and legal use cases.
5. **Hybrid search > vector-only.** Pure vector search misses keyword-specific queries. Always implement hybrid with RRF fusion.
6. **Reranking is essential** for long-context RAG — the first-pass retrieval is noisy.
7. **Cost management:** Long-context inference is expensive. Use hierarchical retrieval (summarize → retrieve → synthesize) instead of dumping everything into context.
