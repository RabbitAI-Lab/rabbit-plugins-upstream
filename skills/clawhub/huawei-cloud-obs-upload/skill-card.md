## Publisher:

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Cloud developers and operators use this skill to inspect OBS bucket storage statistics, upload user-selected local content, or configure recurring uploads to a specified bucket.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Scheduled-upload cleanup may remove unrelated scheduled jobs.

Mitigation: Before enabling recurring uploads, inspect and back up the scheduled-task configuration, remove only the exact approved job, and stop if the configuration cannot be read.

Risk: The documented permissions may be broader than needed and may include deletion despite claims that deletion is disallowed.

Mitigation: Review the IAM policy and scope it to the required bucket and list, read, and upload actions; omit deletion permissions.
