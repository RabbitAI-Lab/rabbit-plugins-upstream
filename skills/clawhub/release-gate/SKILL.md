Use explicitly before systemctl restarts, file deploys, DB migrations, public launches, pricing changes, or emails to real users. Requires named reviewer roles (Dev, QA, Legal, Product) with explicit pass/fail per checklist item. Logs every decision. Does NOT auto-trigger on ambiguous actions — only invoke when the action is clearly irreversible."

# Release Gate

A lightweight, configurable deployment gate for AI agents. Enforces structured sign-off before irreversible actions — no deploy without explicit checklist completion.

## Permissions Required
This skill:
- **Reads** nothing automatically
- **Writes** to a log file you specify (append only)
- Does NOT read env files, system state, or external services
- Does NOT modify AGENTS.md or any agent config

## When to Use This Skill

Read this skill before any action that is:
- **Hard to reverse** — systemctl restart, DB migration, file deploy, data deletion
- **Customer-facing** — public launches, website updates, pricing changes
- **High-stakes** — payments, emails to real users, legal documents going live
- **Team-coordinated** — requiring multiple agents or humans to align first

## Quick Start

```
Before deploying: run through the release gate checklist.
Block if any item is unchecked. Log the result either way.
```

### Minimal Gate (single reviewer)

```
## Release Gate — [Feature Name]

### Dev Sign-Off
- [ ] Code is tested and working
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Secrets and credentials are not hardcoded

### Final Check
- [ ] All boxes above are checked
- [ ] Deployer: [name/agent]

If any box is unchecked: BLOCK. Fix first, then re-run.
```

### Full Gate (multi-role)

```
## Release Gate — [Feature Name]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Deployer: [agent or human name]

### Dev Sign-Off
- [ ] Feature built and tested end-to-end
- [ ] No existing routes/endpoints broken
- [ ] DB migrations are safe and additive (no destructive schema changes)
- [ ] Security review: auth, input validation, IDOR, rate limiting

### Product / Copy Sign-Off
- [ ] Feature is represented on the website/UI
- [ ] Copy accurately describes what the code does
- [ ] No website copy for features that don't exist yet in code
- [ ] Pricing is consistent across all pages/surfaces

### Legal / Compliance Sign-Off (if applicable)
- [ ] Privacy policy covers this feature
- [ ] Regulatory requirements checked (TCPA, GDPR, COPPA, etc.)
- [ ] Any third-party terms reviewed

### Final Check
- [ ] All roles above are aligned
- [ ] No open blockers
- [ ] Log entry written to deployments.log

If any box is unchecked: BLOCK THE DEPLOY. Align first.
```

## Roles — Customize for Your Team

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Dev | Code quality, tests, security |
| Product | UI/copy matches code, pricing consistency |
| Legal | Compliance, terms, privacy |
| QA | Regression testing, edge cases |
| Finance | Pricing, billing, refund policies |

Define only the roles relevant to your project. A solo dev only needs Dev + Final Check.

## Configuring Your Gate

Copy the template that fits your project into your workspace as `DEPLOY_GATE.md` (or inline it in your project's AGENTS.md). Customize the checklist items and role names.

### Example: SaaS Startup

```markdown
# Deploy Gate — MyApp

## Roles
- Dev: code, security, DB
- Product: copy, pricing, UI
- Legal: privacy, compliance

## Trigger On
- systemctl restart myapp
- Changes to app.py, models.py, templates/
- Any update to landing_page.html
- Pricing changes

## Gate Checklist
### Dev
- [ ] Tested locally + staging
- [ ] DB migration safe (additive only)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets

### Product
- [ ] Website matches new feature
- [ ] Pricing pages updated if needed

### Orchestrator
- [ ] Dev + Product aligned
- [ ] Log entry written

## Log File
/opt/myapp/logs/deployments.log
```

## Logging

Every gate run — pass or block — must be logged.

### Log Format

```
[2026-03-30 04:00 UTC] DEPLOY: Add Stripe checkout
  Feature: Stripe payment integration v1
  Dev: PASS | Product: PASS | Legal: PASS
  Deployer: [agent or human]
  Result: APPROVED — systemctl restart myapp executed
```

```
[2026-03-30 04:00 UTC] BLOCKED: Add Stripe checkout
  Feature: Stripe payment integration v1
  Dev: PASS | Product: BLOCKED (pricing page not updated)
  Deployer: [agent or human]
  Result: BLOCKED — deploy held until Product role updates pricing page
```

### Python logging helper

```python
from scripts.release_gate import log_gate_decision

log_gate_decision(
    log_file="/opt/myapp/logs/deployments.log",
    feature="Stripe checkout v1",
    roles={"Dev": "PASS", "Product": "PASS", "Legal": "PASS"},
    result="APPROVED",
    deployer="[your agent or name]",
    notes="systemctl restart myapp"
)
```

## Hard Rules

1. **Any unchecked box = BLOCK.** Do not deploy with open items.
2. **No "I'll fix it after the deploy."** Fix first. Gate second. Deploy third.
3. **Log every decision** — pass and block. The log is the audit trail.
4. **Gate applies to rollbacks too.** A rollback is still a deploy.
5. **When in doubt, ask the user before acting** — do not self-invoke the gate on ambiguous actions.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ "It's just a small change" — small changes break prod  
❌ "I'll update the copy after" — website must match code on deploy  
❌ Skipping Legal row for features that touch user data  
❌ Not logging blocks — partial logs hide patterns  
❌ Running the gate mentally without writing it down  

## Integration With Agent Workflows

### Pre-deploy hook pattern

```python
# In your agent task, before any deploy command:
# Each item requires explicit passed=True — False or missing = BLOCKED
gate_passed = run_release_gate(
    feature="Add subscription billing",
    required_roles=["Dev", "Product"],
    checklist={
        "Dev": [
            {"item": "Tests pass", "passed": True},
            {"item": "No hardcoded secrets", "passed": True},
            {"item": "Migration safe", "passed": True},
        ],
        "Product": [
            {"item": "Pricing page updated", "passed": True},
            {"item": "Copy accurate", "passed": True},
        ],
    },
    log_file="/your/logs/deployments.log",
    deployer="agent",
)
if not gate_passed:
    raise RuntimeError("Release gate not cleared. Blocking deploy.")
```

### With deploy-gate skill

If your project already uses the `deploy-gate` skill, this skill provides the underlying pattern and logging utilities. `deploy-gate` is a project-specific instantiation of `release-gate`.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Does NOT enforce blocking at runtime — there is no code that physically prevents a deploy. The gate works because the agent is instructed to treat it as a hard rule.
- Does NOT detect if the gate was bypassed — if an agent skips the checklist, nothing will catch it automatically. The log is your only audit trail.
- Does NOT handle concurrent approvals — if two agents approve simultaneously, last-write-wins on the log. For multi-agent teams, serialize gate runs.
- Does NOT recover from failed logging — if the log write fails, the deploy decision is unrecorded. Always verify the log entry was written before proceeding.

This is a structured convention enforced by agent instruction, not a runtime enforcement system. That is intentional — the same model used in professional engineering workflows (PR checklists, DORA gates, SOC2 change management). The discipline is the mechanism.
