# Context Sync

You help users sync local files, notes, and context into Aicoo so their shared agent has the right knowledge to represent them.

## Prerequisites

- `AICOO_API_KEY` environment variable must be set
- Base URL: `https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1`

## API Model

- Use `/api/v1/os/*` for workspace-native operations (notes/folders/snapshots/memory/todos/network/share)
- Use `/api/v1/tools` only for non-OS tools (calendar/email/web/messaging/quality/MCP)

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Check current state

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/status" | jq .
```

### Step 2: Browse workspace

```bash
# folders
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/folders" | jq .

# notes in folder
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes?folderId=5&limit=20" | jq .

# note content
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes/42" | jq .
```

### Step 3: Search existing notes first

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"project roadmap"}' | jq .

# deterministic grep (regex/literal + context lines)
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes/grep" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pattern":"roadmap|timeline","mode":"regex","caseSensitive":false,"contextBefore":3,"contextAfter":3}' | jq .
```

### Step 4: Create or update notes

```bash
# create
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Project Roadmap Q2","content":"# Q2 Roadmap\n\n## Goals\n- Launch v2 API"}' | jq .

# snapshot before edit
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/snapshots/42" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label":"Pre-edit"}' | jq .

# edit
curl -s -X PATCH "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes/42" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content":"# Updated Roadmap\n\n..."}' | jq .

# move (mv)
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes/42/move" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"folderName":"Technical"}' | jq .

# copy (cp)
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes/42/copy" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"folderName":"Archive"}' | jq .
```

### Step 5: Bulk file sync

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/accumulate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "files": [
      {"path":"Technical/architecture.md","content":"# Architecture\n\n..."},
      {"path":"General/team-info.md","content":"# Team\n\n..."}
    ]
  }' | jq .
```

### Step 6: Manage folders (owned + shared)

```bash
# list (includes both owned folders and shared-with-me folders)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/folders" | jq .

# create
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/folders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Investor Materials"}' | jq .
```

Shared folders appear with `shared: true` and `role` (viewer/writer/editor/admin). They use the same `folderId` for all operations — list notes, search, create, read, edit.

```bash
# list notes in a shared folder (same as owned)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes?folderId=2213" | jq .

# create note in shared folder (requires editor/admin role)
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Shared Doc","content":"# ...","folderId":2213}' | jq .
```

### Step 7: Delete files

```bash
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/accumulate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"delete":[{"path":"Technical/old-doc.md"}]}' | jq .
```

## Identity Files (`memory/self/`)

Use `/accumulate` to manage:

- `memory/self/COO.md`
- `memory/self/USER.md`
- `memory/self/POLICY.md`

## Links Folder Policy (`links/`)

To customize per-link behavior, edit link notes in `links/`:

```bash
# find link note
curl -s -X POST "https://www.aicoo.io/api/v1/os/notes/search" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AICOO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"For-Investors"}' | jq .
```

Then patch that note via `PATCH /api/v1/os/notes/{id}`.

## When to Use What

| Scenario | Endpoint |
|----------|----------|
| Browse folders (owned + shared) | `GET /os/folders` |
| List notes in folder | `GET /os/notes?folderId=...` |
| Search notes (spans shared folders) | `POST /os/notes/search` |
| Grep notes (spans shared folders) | `POST /os/notes/grep` |
| Read note | `GET /os/notes/{id}` |
| Create note (in owned or shared folder) | `POST /os/notes` |
| Edit note | `PATCH /os/notes/{id}` |
| Move note | `POST /os/notes/{id}/move` |
| Copy note | `POST /os/notes/{id}/copy` |
| Snapshot save/list/restore | `/os/snapshots/{noteId}` + `/restore` |
| Bulk upload/delete | `POST /accumulate` |

## Shared Folders

Shared folders appear in `GET /os/folders` alongside owned folders. They have a real `folderId` (the owner's folder ID) and are addressed identically to owned folders across all endpoints.

- **Search/grep** automatically includes notes in shared folders
- **Read/edit** notes in shared folders works by noteId (access-checked)
- **Create** notes in a shared folder: pass `folderId` in the body (requires editor/admin role)
- **Role permissions**: viewer=read, writer=read+edit, editor=read+create+edit, admin=all

## Best Practices

1. Search before creating to avoid duplicates.
2. Snapshot before major edits.
3. Use `/accumulate` for multi-file sync.
4. Keep identity and link policy files up to date.
5. Shared folder notes are included in search/grep — no special handling needed.
