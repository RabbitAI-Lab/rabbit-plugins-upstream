# Changelog

## v1.8.0

- Add a public TypeScript-monorepo case study that converts clone/API curiosity into a human-readable artifact path.
- Add sanitized case-study notes covering client, server, editor extension, shared packages, backend modules, realtime gateway, database layer, and proof bundle surfaces.
- Add checked generated case-study SVG, HTML, share card, receipts, and gallery/index entries.
- Add README case-study quick-start commands for `deliver` and `bundle`.
- Bump renderer and skill metadata to `1.8.0`.

## v1.7.0

- Ignore junk/build directories during repo extraction by default.
- Prevent generated extractor edges from targeting missing nodes.
- Detect workspace package/app surfaces from monorepo package metadata.
- Add TS/TSX import scanning and per-package import summaries.
- Detect client app, server app, editor extension, backend modules, realtime gateways, database layer, API client, and frontend feature surfaces.
- Refresh generated public examples with the v1.7 extractor.
- Validate the extractor against a private TypeScript monorepo without publishing private artifacts.

## v1.6.0

- Add language-aware repo extraction for Python, package metadata, workflows, schemas, examples, docs, and generated site files.
- Add confidence-scored extraction metadata and source confidence metrics to validation receipts.
- Improve PR delta extraction by grouping changed files into architecture concerns rather than raw filename buckets.
- Tighten source-backed validation so generated evidence artifacts require evidence on every node and edge.
- Upgrade the gallery evidence panel into an evidence drilldown that shows source type, confidence, and extraction rule.
- Refresh generated repo and PR examples from the v1.6 extractor.

## v1.5.1

- Polish the generated Pages gallery artifact rail so the public showcase no longer exposes a native horizontal scrollbar.

## v1.5.0

- Add `extract-repo` to create a first source-backed architecture spec from local repository structure.
- Add `layout` for deterministic mode-aware node placement without hand-authored coordinates.
- Add `extract-pr` to group changed files into a generated PR delta review spec.
- Add `bundle` to export HTML, SVG, share card, receipt, and bundle manifest together.
- Add `--min-quality` gates for `deliver` and `bundle`.
- Add generated repo evidence and PR delta examples to the public gallery.

## v1.4.0

- Add renderer v2 foundations: mode-specific backdrops for architecture, workflow, sequence, data-flow, lifecycle, and PR delta artifacts.
- Add visual quality scoring to validation receipts for overlap, density, route crossings, spacing, and route complexity.
- Add story-aware gallery data and an interactive evidence panel that loads checked spec/receipt JSON on GitHub Pages.
- Add a real visual-architecture case-study artifact with source evidence pointing at the renderer, Makefile, README, and examples.
- Tighten README/SKILL positioning around Archify-standard presentation, local proof, and source-backed case studies.

## v1.3.0

- Redesign the generated gallery into an interactive artifact viewer.
- Put the diagram stage, artifact rail, details panel, and source links into one generated Pages surface.
- Keep the gallery generated from checked JSON examples rather than hand-authored showcase markup.

## v1.2.0

- Add a generated GitHub Pages gallery site as the visual browsing surface.
- Remove the README gallery tables that pushed visitors into raw GitHub file views.
- Generate both root `index.html` and `docs/gallery.html` from the local examples.

## v1.1.1

- Repair package metadata after the v1.1.0 ClawHub publish became non-inspectable.

## v1.1.0

- Add a dark `showcase` render theme for README and release artifacts.
- Add three checked showcase examples for the artifact workflow, repo evidence map, and PR delta review surface.
- Replace the README first-screen diagram with generated showcase artifacts.

## v1.0.2

- Release metadata repair so GitHub and ClawHub package versions both report the final v1 artifact-engine state cleanly.

## v1.0.0

- Complete the planned product ladder from foundation renderer to artifact engine.
- Add schema files for architecture, workflow, sequence, data-flow, lifecycle, PR delta, and shared evidence primitives.
- Add mode-aware validation metrics and examples for all supported diagram modes.
- Add source evidence fields on nodes/edges with validation and visible `SRC n` node badges.
- Add `compare` command for base/head PR delta artifacts and receipts.
- Add static share-card SVG generation and generated proof gallery.
- Expand CI validation to schemas, every example, generated gallery, and PR delta compare smoke.

## v0.3.0

- Reposition visual-architecture as a local-first architecture artifact engine for agents.
- Add `validate`, `render`, and `deliver` commands while preserving the old two-argument render command.
- Add delivery receipts with input/output SHA-256 hashes, byte counts, validation result, warnings, and metrics.
- Add self-contained HTML output in addition to SVG.
- Add checked proof examples for service maps, agent runtimes, repo-evidence maps, and PR delta review maps.
- Expand `make validate` so CI validates every example and proves committed SVGs regenerate byte-for-byte.
- Update the roadmap toward schema diagnostics, multi-diagram modes, source evidence, PR deltas, and share/export artifacts.
