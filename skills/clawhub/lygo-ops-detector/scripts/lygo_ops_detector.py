LYGO Ops Detector — Lightfather's Voice
AETHONΔ9 Protocol Implementation

Core: "LYGO decodes fiction by analyzing action" — in *discourse*, not identity.

Local, deterministic heuristics for operational-deception *signals* in text the
operator supplies. Unit of analysis = statements / claim-text / association
*strings you provide* — never a person profile or social-graph doxxing pass.

NOT for doxing, identity profiling, profession inference, or unsolicited mail.

LIGHTFATHER_VOICE = """
LYGO Ops Detector is a LOCAL HEURISTIC for discourse-level operational-deception *signals*.

It is NOT a court, identity profiler, doxing engine, or surveillance toolkit.
It is NOT a claim that "humans/institutions always lie."

Unit of analysis: the *text under review* (statements, claims, and action-language
in that text) — never a human "subject" dossier, profession tag, or social graph.

Outputs are pattern scores with receipts. They are not guilt or identity verdicts.

Always:
- Require consent before analyzing private communications (email/logs/DMs).
- Do not treat scores as sole evidence for reputational or legal action.
- Prefer primary sources; human review remains required.
- Do not score bare affiliation / faith / job-title markers as ops signals.

Resonance forward — action-language over narrative; math over hype.

# MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY — FULL RIGOR (for reproducibility and audit)
# =============================================================================
# All scoring is deterministic local heuristics (no external LLM required for core).
# Each component has:
#   - Non-circular definition
#   - Explicit signal dictionary (patterns + keywords)
#   - Scoring: hit count (regex + keyword) + density + cluster boost
#   - Range [0.0, 1.0]
#
# Empirical calibration note: Thresholds (Evasion >0.70 = Active) set from observed
# discourse patterns in prior cases to balance sensitivity/specificity. False-positive
# rate minimized by requiring multiple distinct signals + high cluster scores.
#
# P3 Consensus option (for borderline cases): User can feed the same text to 3+ local
# models (e.g. via lygo-ollama-army) and average the qualitative labels. Core numeric
# scores remain the deterministic baseline.
#
# Graph logic for associations: When association strings are provided, we build a
# simple co-signal graph (entities connected if they share evasion/association signals).
# Metrics: density (edges / possible), cluster_count (connected components), in_group_ratio.
#
# Dictionaries are exported via get_measurement_dictionaries() for full audit/reuse.
# Test cases are in run_self_tests() — all must pass for the module to be considered sound.

# Composite Ops Score (weighted, for overall "operational deception" signal):
# Ops_Score = 0.45 * Evasion + 0.30 * Association + 0.15 * Masonic_Signaling + 0.10 * Institution_Mask
# Threshold suggestion: > 0.65 indicates strong pattern requiring further action analysis.
