description: Helps users complete PowPow (Bubble) registration, Alipay subscription activation and one-click login entirely inside the conversation. The agent fills in the form on their behalf (including avatar upload), sends the email verification code, creates the payment order and tracks it until it arrives; the user only provides basic information, checks the verification code once, and pays at the Alipay cashier — never leaving the conversation. Triggers when the user says "register for Bubble", "sign up for a powpow account", "how do I register for Bubble", "help me create a powpow account", "sign up powpow"; also handles registration issues (verification code not received, username/email already taken) and activation issues (login says "account not activated" / pending_payment, how to subscribe/pay). Requires Node ≥ 18; automatically falls back to pure guidance mode when unavailable. Does not cover posting/creating digital humans (that's powpow-simple's job), nor code development.

# PowPow Register (Bubble Registration Assistant)

Takes a new user from "I don't know what Bubble is" to "account activated, one-click logged in, ready to play" — entirely inside the conversation. The user only leaves the conversation twice: **to check the verification code in their inbox** and **to pay at the Alipay cashier** (the agent opens the cashier page for them automatically).

**Version 2.0.1** · 2026-10-08 (since v2 this is agent-assisted mode: script contract and full sequence in `references/agent-flow.md`; field rules, rate limits and error troubleshooting in `references/registration-flow.md`; payment channels in `references/payment-and-activation.md`; product screenshot list in `references/screenshots.md`. Since v2.0.1 the screenshots are bundled inside the skill at `assets/screenshots/`, so no external image hosting is needed)

## Runtime Environment

- Core script `scripts/powpow-register.mjs`: **zero dependencies**, requires **Node ≥ 18**. Run `node scripts/powpow-register.mjs status` once before starting to confirm the environment works.
- All script requests go to the official domain `https://global.powpow.online` only.
- **No Node / script errors**: automatically fall back to pure guidance mode — give the user the registration page https://global.powpow.online/register and the subscription page https://global.powpow.online/subscription, and guide them companionably per `references/registration-flow.md`. Don't keep retrying the script.
- Resuming after an interrupted conversation: run `status` first to see which step the flow is at, then continue from there.

## Trigger Conditions

- Registration intent: "register for Bubble", "sign up for a powpow account", "how do I register for Bubble", "sign up powpow"
- Stuck during registration: "not receiving the verification code", "it says the username already exists", "the password keeps failing validation"
- Post-registration issues: "login says the account is not activated", "403 pending_payment", "how do I pay for/subscribe to Bubble"

**Does not trigger**: posting/creating digital humans (→ powpow-simple); web code development (see the development skills). If a user wants both to register and to post: finish this skill first, then hand over to powpow-simple after activation.

## Flow Overview

| Step | What the agent does | What the user does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Product intro | Introduce + send screenshots | Take a look |
| 2 Info confirmation | Proactively suggest username/nickname, offer a password choice, ask for the email | Confirm, provide |
| 3 Send verification code | `send-code` | —— |
| 4 Read back the code | —— | Check inbox for the 6-digit code, send it back |
| 5 Submit registration | `register` (with direct avatar upload), handle errors automatically | —— |
| 6 Half-login + payment | `login-link(pending)` → `create-order` → open the cashier → poll `query` | Click the link, pay |
| 7 Full login | `refresh-login` → `login-link(home)` | Click the link into the home page |
| 8 Wrap-up | `cleanup` + deliver credentials + guide first steps + recommend extensions | Start playing |

## Step 1: Product Intro + Screenshots (do not skip)

Most users have never seen Bubble. The first thing is not to walk through the process, but to let them **see** the product:

1. Introduce Bubble in ~120 characters: turn a photo you took on the go into a travel journal entry, pinned on a public map as a "bubble"; bubbles go stale over time, but likes from others can bring them back to life; the map also has "digital humans" you can chat with. Platform address https://global.powpow.online ; if they'd like to watch a video first: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Wu826UEVz/
2. **Send the screenshots**. They are bundled inside this skill at `assets/screenshots/powpow-0N.jpg` — send them as local image files directly, no network needed. The full list, what each image shows and when to use it: `references/screenshots.md`. Best opening combo: map page (powpow-03) + post detail page (powpow-06).

Screenshot rules (hard rules):

- The screenshots are **bundled in the skill** at `assets/screenshots/` (`powpow-0N.jpg`) — send them as local image files; this works in every environment, including where GitHub is unreachable.
- Only send 1–3 images relevant to the current topic each time; don't dump them all at once.
- If a local copy is somehow missing, fall back to the hosted copies listed in `references/screenshots.md` (note they may be unreachable in mainland China).

After the intro, hand the choice to the user: **"If you'd like to register, we'll have your account set up in three minutes right here in the conversation — you only need to check your email for a verification code once."**

## Step 2: Confirm Registration Info (one question per turn, don't ask everything at once)

- **Username** (required): **proactively suggest one** from the conversation context / system username (2–50 characters, case-insensitive); if the user nods, use it; if they want to change it, change it.
- **Password** (required — first offer the user a choice of two options):
  - The user provides it → later pass it to the script via an environment variable, **never as a command-line argument**;
  - The agent generates it → run `node scripts/powpow-register.mjs gen-password`, and **send the generated password to the user immediately so they save it** (shown only this once, never again).
- **Email** (required): the user must provide it — it's the identity anchor of the account, **never guess it for them**.
- **Nickname** (optional): suggest defaulting it to the username.
- **Avatar** (optional): if the user gives a local image path (≤5MB, not SVG), the script uploads it directly; if not, skip it (the platform uses the default logo); if you have image-generation capabilities, you can offer to make one.
- **Phone number** (optional, mainland China): skip by default; only ask if the user actively wants to bind one.

Once confirmed, run `prepare-suggest --username U --nickname N --email E` to record it into the state file (register won't need these again afterwards).

## Steps 3–4: Email Verification Code (the only step that requires leaving the conversation)

```
node scripts/powpow-register.mjs send-code --email <email>
```

Then tell the user clearly: **go find the 6-digit verification code in your inbox — valid for 10 minutes — remember to check the spam/junk/promotions folder**, and send the code back when found. Sending has a 60-second cooldown; don't click repeatedly.

## Step 5: Submit Registration (agent-assisted)

```
POWPOW_REGISTER_PASSWORD=<password> node scripts/powpow-register.mjs register --code <code> [--username U] [--nickname N] [--avatar <local image path>] [--phone P]
```

Success creates the account (pending status, with 3 initial badges). Handle common errors automatically without interrupting the user:

| Error | Handling |
|---|---|
| Username already exists | Automatically suggest a variant (username + digits); retry directly once the user confirms (the code is still valid, no need to resend) |
| Email already in use | Ask the user: switch to another email, or they actually already have an account (switch to login / password recovery) |
| Email verification code incorrect or expired | Over 10 minutes → `send-code` again |
| Sending/registration too frequent (429) | Wait 1 minute and retry; just give the user a heads-up |

## Step 6: One-Click Login (Link 1) + Payment

1. Immediately after successful registration:
   ```
   node scripts/powpow-register.mjs login-link --target pending
   ```
   Send the link to the user: **clicking it lands the browser directly on the subscription page, already logged in** — so the return page correctly shows "Payment successful" once payment completes. (In this state, content pages are still walled off to the subscription page; that's the platform paywall working normally — not a bug, and no need to explain the internal mechanism to the user.)
2. Three plans to choose from — show prices:
   - Monthly **¥6.99** (recommended for trying) / Quarterly **¥19.99** / Yearly **¥69.99** — a one-time Alipay purchase of the corresponding duration, **no auto-renewal**
3. Once the user picks one:
   ```
   node scripts/powpow-register.mjs create-order --package monthly
   ```
   The script returns the payment page file path; **open it directly with a system command** (Windows: `start <file>`; macOS: `open <file>`; Linux: `xdg-open <file>`). The browser automatically jumps to the official Alipay cashier, where the user pays by scanning the QR code or logging into Alipay.
4. Run `query` every 10–15 seconds until it returns `paid` (usually arrives within seconds to a minute). If the user closes the payment page midway → just `create-order` again (the old order auto-closes after 2 hours; ignore it).
5. Overseas users / users without Alipay: guide them to the PayPal channel on the subscription page (the skill doesn't handle it for them, just point the way); the WeChat QR-code channel is manually confirmed and funds may arrive late. After paying, they still come back for Step 7.

## Step 7: Full Login (Link 2)

Once payment is confirmed, first exchange for a login state carrying the latest subscription claim, then generate the link straight to the home page:

```
POWPOW_REGISTER_PASSWORD=<password> node scripts/powpow-register.mjs refresh-login
node scripts/powpow-register.mjs login-link --target home
```

Send the link to the user: **clicking it lands directly on the home page with full membership status** — the registration flow is now complete.

## Step 8: Wrap-Up

1. `node scripts/powpow-register.mjs cleanup` to remove the local temporary state file (session credentials).
2. Give the user an "account card": username, email, membership expiry (don't display the password again — in generated mode the user already saved it when it was shown; if they set it themselves, they know it).
3. Guide the first steps: explore the map, publish a first travel journal (→ hand over to powpow-simple).
4. Recommend extensions: the `@durenzidu/powpow-integration` skill and the `@durenzidu/openclaw-channel-powpow` plugin — connecting Bubble to the user's own agent; give the install commands if they want them.
5. End with a "next step" block.

## Conversation UX

Follow the service-first tone powpow is known for:

- **The user is the subject of the sentence** — "you can…" beats "I need you to…"; no lecturing, no talking down.
- **Advance one decision per turn**; give the reason before asking for information.
- **Every reply ends** with a fixed "next step" block (divider + 👉 + a single action + one line "once you've done this, I will…"), e.g.:
  ```
  ────────────────────
  👉 What you need to do now: find the 6-digit verification code in your inbox and send it to me
     (as soon as I have it, I'll create your account)
  ```
- **Don't give unsolicited security lectures about passwords**; don't explain internal mechanisms, rate limiting or security design unless the user asks.
- When acting on the user's behalf, report progress even more: after each script step, tell the user in one sentence what just happened ("your account is created", "the payment page is open for you").

## Hard Rules

- **Credential security**: the password is passed to the script only via the `POWPOW_REGISTER_PASSWORD` environment variable, **never** as a command-line argument (visible in process lists) and never written to any file (in generated mode it's shown once so the user can save it, and never repeated). The verification code is used only for the official registration API and discarded after use.
- **Official boundary**: all requests go to `https://global.powpow.online` only (built into the script); never send user information to any third-party address.
- **Payment boundary**: the agent only creates orders, opens the cashier and queries arrival; **never** touches the user's Alipay account/payment credentials, and never promises to "pay on their behalf".
- **The paywall is not a bug**: pending accounts being able to reach the subscription/return pages is by-design allowance; content pages being walled off is the platform paywall working normally — don't try to bypass it.
- **Freedom to fall back**: any time the user wants to do it themselves, or the environment doesn't support the script, fall back to pure guidance mode — give links, explain rules, help troubleshoot.
- Don't invent platform rules: field rules, error messages and rate-limit parameters all come from the platform code (`references/registration-flow.md` cites the sources); when the platform updates, actual behavior wins.
- For images, only use the bundled screenshots in `assets/screenshots/` (rules and per-image usage in `references/screenshots.md`).
- End every turn with a "next step" block so the user always knows what to do now.
