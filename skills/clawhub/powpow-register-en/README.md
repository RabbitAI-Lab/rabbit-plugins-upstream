# powpow-register

The PowPow Bubble registration assistant (OpenClaw edition): takes a new user from "I don't know what Bubble is" to
"account activated, one-click logged in, ready to play" — product intro (with UI screenshots), agent-assisted registration
(including avatar upload), Alipay subscription order creation with arrival tracking, dual-link one-click login, and error troubleshooting.

**Since v2.0.0 this is agent-assisted mode**: the core script `scripts/powpow-register.mjs` is zero-dependency
(Node ≥ 18); the user never leaves the conversation except twice: checking the verification code in their inbox, and paying
at the Alipay cashier. Without Node, or when the user prefers to do it themselves, it automatically falls back to pure guidance mode.

## Installation

```
openclaw skills install @durenzidu/powpow-register
```

## Features

1. **Product intro**: ~120-character opening + UI screenshots bundled inside the skill
   (6 images in `assets/screenshots/`: map page, post detail page, etc.; send 1–3 depending on the scenario — no external image hosting, works offline).
2. **Assisted registration**: the agent proactively suggests username/nickname, offers a password choice (user-provided or agent-generated),
   sends and submits the verification code, uploads the avatar directly (≤5MB, non-SVG), and handles common errors automatically (taken/expired/rate-limited).
3. **One-click login (dual links)**: right after successful registration, a "half-logged-in" link lands the user on the subscription page;
   once payment arrives, a fresh login state is exchanged and a full-membership link lands them on the home page
   (via the platform's official `me?token=` bridge, which plants the HttpOnly cookie automatically).
4. **Subscription payment**: the agent handles Alipay order creation (monthly ¥6.99 / quarterly ¥19.99 / yearly ¥69.99,
   one-time purchase, no auto-renewal) + polls for arrival; overseas users fall back to PayPal; WeChat QR code / Huawei IAP are pointed to.
5. **Error troubleshooting**: verification code not received, username/email taken, 403 not activated, account locked and other
   common issues — all taken from the platform source code with citations.

## Security

- **The password** is passed into the script process only via an environment variable — never as a command-line argument, never written to disk, never stored in the state file;
  an agent-generated password is shown once for the user to save.
- **The verification code** is used only for the official registration API and discarded after use; the state file (email/username/token/order number)
  lives in the system temp directory and is removed with one `cleanup` at the end of the flow.
- **Payment**: the agent only creates orders, opens the cashier and queries arrival; it never touches the user's Alipay account
  or payment credentials, and never pays on their behalf. Payment always happens between the user and the official Alipay cashier.
- All requests go to the official domain `https://global.powpow.online` only; contains no secrets.
