# powpow-register

The PowPow Bubble registration assistant (OpenClaw edition): takes a new user from "I don't know what Bubble is" to
"account activated, one-click logged in, ready to play" — product intro (with UI screenshots), agent-assisted registration
(including avatar upload), Alipay/PayPal subscription order creation with arrival tracking, dual-link one-click login, and error troubleshooting.

**Since v2.0.0 this is agent-assisted mode, and since v2.1.0 PayPal can be handled too**: the core script `scripts/powpow-register.mjs` is zero-dependency
(Node ≥ 18); the user never leaves the conversation except twice: checking the verification code in their inbox, and paying
at the Alipay/PayPal cashier. Without Node, or when the user prefers to do it themselves, it automatically falls back to pure guidance mode.

## Installation

```
openclaw skills install @durenzidu/powpow-register
```

## Features

1. **Product intro**: ~120-character opening + UI screenshots bundled inside the skill
   (6 images in `assets/screenshots/`: map page, post detail page, etc.; send 1–3 depending on the scenario — no external image hosting, works offline).
2. **Assisted registration**: the agent proactively suggests username/nickname, offers a password choice (user-provided or agent-generated),
   sends and submits the verification code, uploads the avatar directly (≤5MB, non-SVG), and handles common errors automatically (taken/expired/rate-limited).
3. **One-click login (dual links)**: right after successful registration, a "half-logged-in" link lands the user on the subscription page;
   once payment arrives, a fresh login state is exchanged and a full-membership link lands them on the home page
   (via the platform's official `me?token=` bridge, which plants the HttpOnly cookie automatically).
4. **Subscription payment**: both Alipay (monthly ¥6.99 / quarterly ¥19.99 / yearly ¥69.99,
   one-time purchase, no auto-renewal) and PayPal (Premium Monthly, about $1/month, auto-renews, cancel anytime) are handled by the agent with order creation + arrival polling; WeChat QR code / Huawei IAP are pointed to.
5. **Error troubleshooting**: verification code not received, username/email taken, 403 not activated, account locked and other
   common issues — all taken from the platform source code with citations.

## Security

- **The password** is passed into the script process only via an environment variable — never as a command-line argument, never written to disk, never stored in the state file;
  an agent-generated password is shown once for the user to save.
- **The verification code** is used only for the official registration API and discarded after use; the state file (email/username/token/order number)
  lives in the system temp directory and is removed with one `cleanup` at the end of the flow.
- **Payment**: the agent only creates orders, opens the cashier and queries arrival; it never touches the user's Alipay/PayPal account
  or payment credentials, and never pays on their behalf. Payment always happens between the user and the official cashier.
- All requests go to the official domain `https://global.powpow.online` only; contains no secrets.
