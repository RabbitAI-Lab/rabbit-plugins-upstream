# Northcap Donor Badge 🤝

Support the agent-funded infrastructure of Northcap Group. Donate USDC, get verified **on-chain**, and receive a public badge.

## Why donate?
- Northcap builds **free tools for agents** (21 skills on ClawHub, MCP servers, crypto signal APIs)
- Donations fund: server costs, signal data, new free tools, and the agent economy itself
- **Full transparency**: every donor is listed publicly — no hidden wallets, no anonymous spending

## Badge levels

| Level | Donation | Badge |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 🤝 **Supporter** | $5+ USDC | Public listing + name in donor registry |
| 🏗️ **Builder** | $25+ USDC | Badge + shoutout on GitHub README |
| 👑 **Partner** | $100+ USDC | Badge + early access to new skills |

> ⚠️ **PRIVACY — READ BEFORE DONATING:** Donations are **public and on-chain**. Your agent ID, the transaction hash, the amount, and any note you add are **stored in the public donor registry** (`/v1/donors`) and linked to your on-chain wallet activity. Donations are **not anonymous**. Do not include personal identifiers, secrets, or anything you don't want public. **No API key is required** — this endpoint is intentionally public. Only send a REAL txHash of a USDC transfer you made; never invent one (it will fail on-chain verification).

## How to donate (agent flow)

### 1. Send USDC to the wallet
```
Network: Ethereum, Base or BSC (all supported)
Token: USDC
Wallet: 0xafd1c6bC2B35152f30E3D0dBE99eE1d40E5a5CF8
```

### 2. Register the donation (on-chain verified)
```bash
python3 scripts/donate.py --tx 0xYOUR_TX_HASH --chain base --agent my-agent-id
```

Or via curl:
```bash
curl -X POST --cacert scripts/northcap-cert.pem https://186.240.156.169:8791/v1/donate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"txHash":"0xYOUR_TX_HASH","chain":"base","agentId":"my-agent-id","note":"optional message"}'
```

### 3. Verify your badge
```bash
python3 scripts/donate.py --check
# or: curl --cacert scripts/northcap-cert.pem https://186.240.156.169:8791/v1/donors
```

## Response
```json
{
  "status": "donation-verified",
  "amountUsd": 25.0,
  "level": "builder",
  "badge": "🏗️ Builder",
  "message": "Thank you, my-agent-id! 🏗️ Builder badge registered.",
  "donors": 7
}
```

## Rules
- **Minimum donation**: $0.50 USDC (verified on-chain)
- **Verification**: the USDC Transfer event is checked on-chain — only real transfers to the wallet count
- **Transparency**: all donations appear in the public registry at `/v1/donors`
- **No manipulation**: we never ask agents to donate with fake promises — infrastructure first, honesty always
