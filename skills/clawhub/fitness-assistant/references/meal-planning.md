# Meal planning rules

## Safety boundaries (non-negotiable)

- This is general lifestyle guidance, not medical advice. Never diagnose or treat.
- Pregnant, nursing, under 18, chronic illness, or medication that affects diet: recommend consulting a doctor/dietitian before following the plan.
- Calorie floor: never plan below **1,200 kcal/day (female)** or **1,500 kcal/day (male)**; use **1,600+ kcal for adults 65+**. If the computed target is below the floor, use the floor and explain why.
- Healthy weight-loss pace is about **0.25–0.5 kg/week** (a deficit of ~250–500 kcal/day). Never exceed a **750 kcal/day deficit**.
- Always include hydration; never plan skipped meals.

## Numbers (script output; manual fallback below)

- BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)²
- BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor): men `10w + 6.25h − 5a + 5`; women `10w + 6.25h − 5a − 161` (w = kg, h = cm, a = years)
- TDEE = BMR × activity multiplier:

| Activity | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| Sedentary (desk, little exercise) | 1.2 |
| Light (1–3 sessions/week) | 1.375 |
| Moderate (3–5 sessions/week) | 1.55 |
| Active (6–7 sessions/week) | 1.725 |
| Very active (physical job + training) | 1.9 |

- Calorie target: lose = TDEE − 400 (deficit capped at 750, floored); maintain = TDEE; gain = TDEE + 250
- Macros: protein **1.6–2.2 g/kg** body weight (higher end when training or losing weight; 0.8–1.0 for sedentary maintenance); fat **20–35% of calories** (at least ~0.6 g/kg); carbs = remaining calories ÷ 4 g. Fiber ≥ 25–30 g. Water ≈ 30–35 ml/kg (about 2–3 L for most adults).

## Day structure

- Three main meals + 1–2 snacks, roughly: breakfast 25%, lunch 35%, dinner 30%, snacks 10%. Adjust to the user's routine — e.g. an early-morning workout moves more calories to pre/post-training.
- Every meal should contain: lean protein (about a palm), vegetables (half the plate), whole-grain/starchy carbs (about a fist, adjusted to the calorie target), healthy fat (about a thumb), plus fruit/dairy where allowed.

## Food groups and swaps

| Group | Examples | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Protein | chicken, fish, eggs, lean beef, tofu, tempeh, lentils, chickpeas, dairy, soy milk | Vegetarian/vegan: tofu, tempeh, lentils, chickpeas, soy products, beans |
| Carbs | rice, oats, whole-wheat bread, potatoes, noodles, quinoa, fruit | Prefer whole grains; spread intake across meals |
| Vegetables | all vegetables, leafy greens | Half of each plate |
| Fats | olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado | Small portions |

- Restrictions: halal (halal-certified meat), vegetarian/vegan (plant proteins), lactose-intolerant (dairy-free alternatives), gluten-sensitive (rice, quinoa, gluten-free oats).
- Hypertension: reduce sodium, prefer fresh over processed food. Diabetes: spread carbs evenly across meals, prefer low-GI sources, avoid sugary drinks. Keep this general and refer to a professional for medication-related advice.

## Ingredient choices (build-your-own menu)

After computing the calorie/macro targets, let the user build their own menu:

1. Show choices per meal in the user's language — one protein, one carb, vegetables, one fat, plus an optional fruit/snack — as a compact list (not the full table) using the options below.
2. Let the user pick. If they say "you choose"/"随便", pick the defaults (marked ★) and say so.
3. Assemble the day so totals land within **±100 kcal** of the calorie target with macros staying close, adjusting serving sizes rather than dropping foods. If a preferred food is calorie-dense, use a smaller portion — never skip the protein.
4. Respect restrictions and disliked foods from the profile; ask before introducing something new.
5. Save the chosen ingredients as the user's preferences so future runs reuse them; ask again only when the user wants to change.

Approximate values per serving (cooked weights unless noted); scale portions ±20–50% to fit the day's target:
