# Skill Local Overlay

Purpose: stop losing local modifications when marketplace/connector/builtin skills upgrade. In-place edits to those layers are wiped by the next platform update. This skill wraps every change in snapshot → ledger → replay.

## Asset Layer Classification (do this first)

1. [Deterministic] Identify which layer the skill lives in:
   - **Agent-created** (frontmatter `agent_created: true`, user skills dir): owned locally → edit directly, no overlay needed.
   - **Marketplace-installed**: overwritten on reinstall/upgrade → overlay required.
   - **Connector skills**: overwritten when the connector updates → overlay required.
   - **Builtin / plugin cache** (versioned directories): overwritten on every plugin upgrade → overlay required.

## Workflow

1. [Deterministic] **Snapshot**: before touching anything, copy the original file(s) into the overlay directory with the upstream version recorded: `<overlay-root>/<skill-name>/<upstream-version>/<filename>.orig`. Standard overlay root: `~/.workbuddy/skills-overlays/`.
2. [Deterministic] **Ledger entry**: append one entry to `<overlay-root>/<skill-name>/ledger.md`:
   - date, upstream version, file path, what changed and why, snapshot location.
   - One entry per change. No batching multiple edits into one vague entry.
3. [Deterministic] **Apply the patch** to the live file. Keep patches minimal and additive where possible (small sed-able edits, not full-file rewrites) so they survive upstream drift.
4. [LLM] **Replay after upgrade**: when the upstream version changes, diff the new upstream file against the snapshot. Re-apply each ledger entry that still applies; report entries that no longer apply cleanly (upstream restructured) for a human decision.
5. [Deterministic] **Verify after replay**: re-run the diff; confirm every replayed patch is present in the live file; update the ledger with the new upstream version.

## Hard Rules

- Never edit a marketplace/connector/builtin skill without a snapshot + ledger entry first.
- Never delete snapshots or ledger history.
- Replay must be idempotent: applying the same patch twice must not duplicate content.
- Patches stay minimal; if a "patch" grows beyond ~50 lines of change, raise it as a fork decision instead of a patch.
- Ledger entries record WHY, not just WHAT.

## Failure Handling

- Snapshot copy fails (permissions, path issues): stop, do not edit. Report the exact path and error.
- Upstream upgrade changes a file so a patch no longer applies: keep the live file unpatched, mark the ledger entry STALE, and surface the conflict — never force-merge blindly.
- Overlay directory missing at replay time: treat as fresh start, re-snapshot, recreate the ledger, and note the gap.

## Output Format

Report: layer classification → snapshot path → ledger entry ID → patch summary. After replay: per-entry status table (APPLIED / STALE / CONFLICT) + new upstream version.
