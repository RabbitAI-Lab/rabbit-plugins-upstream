      }
    }

## Getting a platform token

1. Go to https://www.play-asia.com/account/access-tokens
2. Log in to your Play-Asia account
3. Choose scope: **Info** (read-only) or **Purchase** (can spend wallet balance)
4. Set optional daily/weekly spending limits
5. Click **Generate Token** — copy it immediately (shown only once)

## How Lightning purchases work (optional)

For users with a Bitcoin Lightning wallet — no account needed:

```
1. Agent calls buy_digital_product({ pax: "PAX0004012102" })
   → Returns Lightning invoice (e.g. 58,694 sats)

2. Pay the invoice with any Lightning wallet → get the preimage

3. Agent calls buy_digital_product({ pax: "...", l402_token: "MACAROON:PREIMAGE" })
   → Receives the digital code instantly
```
