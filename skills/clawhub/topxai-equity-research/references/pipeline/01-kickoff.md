# 1. Kickoff: choose the topic and set the terms

> This is step 1 of the pipeline in `SKILL.md`. Next step: `02-research.md`.

- **Type**: `equity` (single company), `industry` (value chain), `macro` (macro or strategy), `quarterly` (quarterly report).
- **Series key** (`report_series`): the ticker for a company (for example `IREN`), a kebab-case topic for a thematic series
  (for example `ai-value-chain`). Every later update of the series reuses the key, and the ledger, the watch file and the
  update chain all hang off it. Decide the boundary of the series now.
- **Report directory**: `research/<report-id>/`, where `<report-id>` is the series key plus a date, such as
  `report-<ticker>-deep-dive-<yyyy-mm>`.
- **Compare candidates** when there are three or more (use `assets/templates/kickoff.md`). Score each candidate 1-10 through
  four lenses: evidence density and verifiability; difference from existing coverage; whether a tradable judgment can be
  made; reader demand and discoverability. **If evidence density or tradable judgment is 4 or lower, the candidate is out.**
  Above that bar, decide on the whole picture and write down "why not the other candidates".
- **Liquidity threshold**: market cap of at least $2 billion and 20-day average daily turnover of at least $20 million. A
  reader cannot act on a report about a stock below the bar. The user may waive it by naming the company.
- **Read the settlement record first**: the last 30 lines of `research/lessons.md` and `research/patterns.md`. In the
  candidate comparison, count how many open ratings share the new candidate's factor exposure. Several underweights on the
  same high-beta theme will all flip in one rally, and the scoreboard then measures one market move. This is one input to
  the choice. It never changes the rule that a rating follows the evidence.
- **The kickoff brief** is `research/<report-id>/notes-00-kickoff.md`. It holds: the verdict and reasons; the data basis
  date at three layers (hard rule 3 in `SKILL.md`); the rating benchmark (default: S&P 500 total return, or a more
  investable index when `judgment.md` section 4 supports one); hard constraints on form (do not repeat the previous
  report's framework); research discipline (the four sentences in `references/agents.md`); and the data plan. The
  initiation memo of Step 0 in `references/equity.md` follows it.

## Deciding not to publish is also an output

A user once asked for an update to an existing report. Three primary-source checks (SEC EDGAR, transaction-level government
contract data, and official investor-relations and trade-press sources) found no 8-Ks in the window. New government
obligations were a rounding error against company guidance. A forced Delta update could only restate what had been published
days earlier. The right call was **do not update**.

Write the reasoning and the restart triggers into the kickoff brief and hand it to the user. That is a deliverable. Before
starting any report, ask one question: does this period contain anything new to write?
