# Kraken CLI

> ⚠️ **Real money warning.** This skill can reach a live Kraken account with
> real funds. Market data and paper trading are safe and need no API key. Any
> command run with credentials present — `kraken setup`, authenticated
> `kraken mcp`, or live order commands — can place real orders and lose real
> money. Start in paper trading. Confirm with the user before any authenticated
> or order-placing command, and never place a live order without an explicit
> request to trade.

The official AI-native CLI for trading crypto, stocks, forex, and derivatives on Kraken. Built for agents — structured JSON output, consistent error envelopes, built-in MCP server, and paper trading with no API key required.

**Repo:** https://github.com/krakenfx/kraken-cli
**Docs:** See `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, and `skills/` in the repo for agent integration guides.

Verify install:

```bash
kraken --version

## Paper Trading (No API Key Needed)

Safe sandbox against live prices — no account, no real money:

```bash
kraken paper init --balance 10000 -o json
kraken paper buy BTCUSD 0.01 -o json
kraken paper status -o json
kraken paper history -o json
kraken paper reset -o json
```

Futures paper trading also available: `kraken futures paper`

## Live Market Data (No API Key Needed)

```bash
kraken ticker BTCUSD -o json
kraken orderbook BTCUSD --count 10 -o json
kraken ohlc BTCUSD --interval 60 -o json
```

## MCP Server

Built-in Model Context Protocol server over stdio — works with Claude, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and OpenClaw:

```bash
kraken mcp                    # market + account + paper (default)
kraken mcp -s market,paper    # read-only, no auth needed
kraken mcp -s all             # all services (dangerous calls require acknowledged=true)
```

Add to your MCP client config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kraken": {
      "command": "kraken",
      "args": ["mcp", "-s", "market,paper"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication (Live Trading)

> ⚠️ **These credentials give full control of the account's trading balance.**
> A key that cannot withdraw funds can still open, modify, and close real
> orders, and those orders can lose real money. Treat the key as sensitive
> account access. Confirm with the user before running any authenticated
> command, and never place a live order without an explicit request to trade.

```bash
# Interactive setup — prompts for the key, keeps it out of shell history
kraken setup

# Or via environment variables
export KRAKEN_API_KEY="your-key"
export KRAKEN_API_SECRET="your-secret"
```

Get API keys at: https://www.kraken.com (Settings > API)

**Credential handling:**

- **Never pass keys directly on the CLI** — use `kraken setup` or environment
  variables to avoid shell history exposure.
- **Prefer `kraken setup` over exported env vars** for a persistent setup. It
  stores credentials in the tool's own config file with restrictive
  permissions rather than in shell history or a `.env` file you might commit.
- **If you use environment variables**, set them only for the current shell
  session, and do not write them into a file that could be committed. Do not
  echo them, print them, or include them in logs.
- **Scope the key.** Where Kraken offers it, restrict the key to the minimum
  permissions needed, and disable withdrawal access unless the user explicitly
  needs it.
- **Never reuse a key that has appeared in a log, chat, or commit.** Rotate it
  at https://www.kraken.com (Settings > API) instead.

## Agent Integration Tips

- Always use `-o json` — stdout is always valid JSON on success
- Route on the `error` field in error envelopes, not `message`
- Paper trading is the right starting point for any new agent setup
- The repo's `skills/` folder contains 50 goal-oriented workflow packages
- `AGENTS.md` and `CONTEXT.md` in the repo cover rate limits, error handling, and invocation patterns
- Prefer the read-only MCP scope (`kraken mcp -s market,paper`) unless the
  user explicitly needs account access. `-s all` enables order-capable
  services — confirm before using it
- Stay on paper trading (`kraken paper ...`) until the user explicitly asks
  to trade live
