# Topos

Topos scores code on three pillars — **SIMPLE**, **COMPOSABLE**, **SECURE** — and maps results to a medal lattice (SLOP → GOLD). Use it in a closed loop: measure, edit, re-measure.

## Use Case

Developers and AI coding agents use this skill to improve structural code quality, reduce complexity, verify refactors, and optimize toward GOLD or SILVER medals. It supports both CLI and MCP agent loops on local repositories.

**Deployment geography:** Global (local execution; no region-restricted services).

## When to Use

Load this skill when the user asks to improve code quality, reduce complexity, check structural security footguns, verify a refactor, or optimize toward GOLD/SILVER medals.

## Requirements / Dependencies

**Requires API Key or External Credential:** No

**Credential Type(s):** None

**Runtime dependencies:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://docs.krv.ai/topos/install.sh | bash
npm install -g gitnexus   # enables COMPOSABLE / GOLD scoring
```

- `topos` CLI on `PATH` (install via [docs.krv.ai/topos/install.sh](https://docs.krv.ai/topos/install.sh))
- Git repository for baseline comparisons (`topos assess_worktree_change`, untracked baselines via snapshot flow)
- `.gitnexus` dependency graph for COMPOSABLE / GOLD scoring (generated automatically when `gitnexus` is installed; force refresh with `topos depgraph generate` or `topos_generate_depgraph`)

COMPOSABLE is scored by default: `evaluate` / `inspect` and the MCP evaluate
tools detect a missing or stale `.gitnexus` and regenerate it before scoring.
Run `topos depgraph generate` only to force a refresh.

**Optional MCP setup** (for tool-based agents, not required for CLI-only use):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio topos -- topos mcp
```

Do not include secrets in prompts, logs, or output. Topos reads local source files and git state only; it does not transmit code to external services.

## Known Risks and Mitigations

Risk: The skill may guide agents to apply structural refactors that change behavior; Topos measures structure, not functional correctness.

Mitigation: Run project tests or linters after each edit; treat Topos verdicts as structural signals, not proof of correctness.

Risk: Agents may trust SECURE medal findings as full security assurance; Topos SECURE checks are structural heuristics, not full SAST.

Mitigation: Pair with dedicated security tooling for high-stakes code; acknowledge remaining SECURE findings explicitly.

Risk: Without GitNexus installed, COMPOSABLE scores are unavailable and GOLD is unreachable.

Mitigation: Install `gitnexus` (`npm install -g gitnexus`); check MCP `warnings` and `coupling_available` before trusting composability scores.

Risk: Cosmetic edits (whitespace, rename-only) may appear as improvements but do not move the lattice.

Mitigation: Stop when MCP returns `SUSPICIOUS_NO_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE`; require `IMPROVEMENT` or `IMPROVEMENT_SCORE` before accepting a change.

## Skill Output

**Output type(s):** Analysis, markdown reports, JSON (MCP), shell commands

**Output format:** CLI tables and ranked file lists; MCP structured payloads with `agent_contract` fields; per-function inspect detail

**Output parameters:** Medal verdict (SLOP → GOLD), pillar scores (SIMPLE, COMPOSABLE, SECURE), ranked refactor targets, assessment status (`IMPROVEMENT`, `REGRESSION`, etc.)

**Other properties:** Writes `.gitnexus` graph artifacts when depgraph is generated; does not modify source files unless the agent chooses to edit based on guidance

## Agent Loop

1. **Measure** — `topos evaluate <path> -r` (CLI) or `topos_evaluate_file` / `topos_evaluate_project` (MCP). COMPOSABLE is included by default; run the CLI from the repo root (MCP: set file root to that repo). Pass `gitnexus_dir` only to select a non-default store under that root.
2. **Inspect** — `topos inspect <file>` or `topos_inspect_code` for per-function complexity and metric detail.
3. **Edit** — one focused structural change (extract helper, simplify branch, decouple import).
4. **Verify** — re-run evaluate, or use `topos_assess_worktree_change` (baseline `HEAD`) for MCP loops. For untracked baselines: `topos_begin_refactor` → edit → `topos_assess_snapshot`.
5. **Behavior check** — run project tests or linters; Topos does not prove correctness.

Stop when the target medal is reached, the priority pillar passes, or further iterations plateau. Prefer structured `agent_contract` fields over parsing prose.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `topos evaluate <path> -r` | Show the cumulative project quality rollup |
| `topos evaluate <path> -r --failures <pillar>` | List the files whose gates fail one pillar |
| `topos evaluate <path> -r --info` | Select a weak file and show ranked line-level refactor targets |
| `topos config` | View or edit project priority and preference settings |
| `topos inspect <file>` | Deep per-file metrics and suggestions |
| `topos compare <a> <b>` | AST edit distance between two versions |
| `topos coverage <source>... --tests <test>... [-r]` | Structural test coverage (UAST + k-gram recall) |
| `topos depgraph generate` | Build GitNexus graph for COMPOSABLE scoring |
| `topos graphify generate\|orphans` | Advisory orphan / fragile-edge hints (does not affect evaluate) |
| `topos mcp` | Start the MCP server for tool-based agent loops |

Run CLI `evaluate` / `inspect` / `depgraph` from the **repo root that owns `.gitnexus`**. COMPOSABLE freshness and `gitnexus analyze` always use process **cwd** as the project root; `--gitnexus-dir` only selects a store path under that cwd (default `<cwd>/.gitnexus`) — it does not retarget the root. Pass `--no-composable` to score SIMPLE/SECURE only. The CLI accepts a one-run `--priority` override (a single pillar or a full comma-separated ranking) and `topos config` persists project defaults; MCP additionally returns the induced preference walk. Advisory `cycles`/`dependencies`/`process` hints are MCP-only, via `topos_refactor`.

For MCP, the same rule uses the server **file root** (`TOPOS_MCP_FILE_ROOT`, else server cwd): set the file root to the repo, and use `gitnexus_dir` only for a non-default store under that root.

## MCP Tool Reference

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `topos_get_doc(topic="agent-contract")` | Compact loop contract — read first |
| `topos_evaluate_file` | Score one file; returns 3 ranked edit spans (`refactor_targets`, gate failures first) |
| `topos_evaluate_project` | Project rollup and worst-file list |
| `topos_inspect_code` | Deep per-function complexity and metrics |
| `topos_assess_worktree_change` | Compare working tree to a git baseline |
| `topos_begin_refactor` / `topos_assess_snapshot` | Snapshot flow for untracked baselines |
| `topos_assess_improvement` | Side-by-side variant comparison |
| `topos_assess_changeset` | Assess several edited files at once against a git baseline |
| `topos_generate_depgraph` / `topos_depgraph_status` | Force-refresh, or read-only diagnose, the GitNexus graph |
| `topos_calculate_coverage` | Structural test coverage (separate from lattice) |
| `topos_evaluate_code` | Score a source string when there is no file on disk |
| `topos_inspect_code` / `topos_compare_code` / `topos_compare_files` | Deep metrics; AST edit distance between two versions |
| `topos_preference_walk` | Resolve target / fallback / next-step verdicts for a ranking |
| `topos_refactor` | Advisory hotspots (`cycles`, `dependencies`, `process`, `graphify`) — never affects the medal |
| `topos_generate_graphify_graph` | Build the Graphify knowledge graph for `topos_refactor(target="graphify")` |

MCP tool arguments are **flat objects** — `{"filepath": "..."}`, not `{"params": {...}}`.

## Pitfalls

- **No GitNexus → no COMPOSABLE.** The graph is generated automatically, but only if `gitnexus` is installed. If it isn't, `coupling_available` is `false` and GOLD is unreachable — check `warnings`.
- **Wrong cwd / file root → slow or hung COMPOSABLE setup.** Freshness fingerprints the whole project root (CLI cwd / MCP file root). Running from `$HOME` with `--gitnexus-dir ~/…/repo/.gitnexus` still walks home and can appear stuck on “indexing”; `cd` into the repo (or point MCP `TOPOS_MCP_FILE_ROOT` at it) instead.
- **Cosmetic edits don't count.** Whitespace and rename-only changes won't move the lattice; MCP returns `SUSPICIOUS_NO_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE`.
- **SECURE is structural, not full SAST.** Pair with dedicated security tooling for high-stakes code.
- **`topos refactor` is advisory.** It does not replace `topos evaluate` for scoring.

## Verification

A change is ready when:

- Assessment status is `IMPROVEMENT` or `IMPROVEMENT_SCORE` (MCP), or the evaluate verdict improved (CLI).
- Status is not `SUSPICIOUS_NO_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE` or `REGRESSION`.
- Active SECURE findings are fixed or explicitly acknowledged.
- Relevant tests/type checks pass, or their absence is reported.

## Ethical Considerations

Users should review agent-proposed code changes before committing, especially when refactoring production systems. Topos is an advisory structural quality tool; organizations should apply their own security, compliance, and code-review policies before deployment.
