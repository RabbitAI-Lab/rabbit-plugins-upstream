# JPVerify — pick the right Japan business check

Version 1.2.1 · JPVerify · https://www.jpverify.com

Use this skill to route a task to the right JPVerify endpoint. For the common tasks, the focused skills have detailed workflows:

| Task | Skill |
|---|---|
| T-number and invoice issuer checks (name, address, registration on the invoice date), issuer vs supplier master | `jp-invoice-number-check` |
| Japanese company from an English name or identifier, corporate number, filings, FSA licences | `jp-company-verify` |
| Japanese address normalization, validation, geocoding, postal codes | `jp-address` |
| Japanese supplier / counterparty pre-check before onboarding or payment | `jp-supplier-due-diligence` |
| JP PINT (Peppol) e-invoice XML validation | `jp-pint-invoice-validation` |

If they are not installed, follow the routing below directly.

## Connect / 接続

JPVerify is a paid, per-call API. Pick the first option that applies; never guess credentials.

1. **API key (recommended).** If the environment has `JPVERIFY_API_KEY` (a `jpv_live_…` key the user created), send it on every call:
   - HTTP: header `Authorization: Bearer $JPVERIFY_API_KEY` (or `X-API-Key`).
   - MCP: if the JPVerify Claude Code plugin is installed, the `jpverify` MCP server is already configured and uses the key saved in the plugin's settings (`/plugin` → JPVerify → Configure), not `JPVERIFY_API_KEY`. Otherwise: `claude mcp add --transport http jpverify https://api.jpverify.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer $JPVERIFY_API_KEY" --header "X-JPVerify-Client: jpverify/1.2.1"`
   Each successful call is deducted from the user's prepaid USD credits; failed or invalid calls are refunded automatically. Before a large batch, check the balance for free: `GET https://api.jpverify.com/v1/account/balance` with the same header, or the MCP tool `jpverify_balance`.
2. **x402 wallet.** If you have an x402 client with USDC on Base (`eip155:8453`) and the user approved a budget, call without a key: the API answers HTTP 402 with the exact price; sign and retry with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`. Pay only within the approved budget.
3. **Neither.** Do not pay and do not invent a key. The MCP server also works without a key for the free tool `jpverify_guide` (`claude mcp add --transport http jpverify https://api.jpverify.com/mcp`); use it to confirm which call fits, then tell the user they can create a free account with starter credit at https://www.jpverify.com/signup?ref=jpverify and set `JPVERIFY_API_KEY`.

Always send `X-JPVerify-Client: jpverify/1.2.1` on HTTP calls. Never print, log or share the API key.

## Routing / 使い分け

1. **English company name or an identifier, need the Japanese legal entity in English?** `POST /v1/jp/companies/resolve` (MCP `jp_company_resolve`).
2. **Unsure which call fits?** Ask the free MCP tool `jpverify_guide` with the task in plain words, or use the table below.
3. **JPVerify does not read files.** Read invoices, receipts and business cards yourself, then send the fields. Prefer one call that answers the question (e.g. `/v1/jp/invoices/check-issuer` with the issuer name and invoice date instead of separate lookups; `/v1/jp/suppliers/resolve` for a supplier with several identifiers).
4. **Batches:** up to 100 items use the `*-batch` endpoints (priced per item: `companies/verify-batch` and `invoice-registrations/verify-batch` $0.008, `invoices/check-issuer-batch` $0.04); larger jobs (up to 1,000) use `/v1/batch-jobs`, which is x402-only and needs a caller-chosen capability token and an `Idempotency-Key` header. Always confirm the total cost with the user first.

## Reading results / 結果の読み方

- Every registry result names its `source` and the as-of date of the data. Quote them when you report.
- Most results carry `decision_summary.status`, one vocabulary across endpoints: `verified`, `likely_match`, `candidates`, `not_found`, `manual_review` or `insufficient_coverage`, with machine-readable `reasons`. Act on it the same way everywhere: only `verified` is a confirmed match; `likely_match` and `candidates` need the user's confirmation or an identifier; `manual_review` needs a person; `insufficient_coverage` means no conclusion either way.
- Check `status` / `decision`, `risk_flags` and `manual_review_required` before acting. Ambiguous or multiple matches go back to the user.
- English names: NTA official → EDINET → romanized reading; English addresses: official or Japan Post romanization, with `completeness` (`partial` English never replaces the Japanese `address`). Company and supplier checks search registered Japanese names; start from `/v1/jp/companies/resolve` when you only have an English name. Check `*_source` before relying on one, and use `legal_name_ja` (always returned) on legal documents. Empty means no English source exists, not an error.

## Errors and spending / エラーと費用

| Response | What to do |
|---|---|
| `200` | Use the result (see "Reading results"). With an API key, `X-JPVerify-Credits-Charged` and `X-JPVerify-Credits-Remaining` show the cost and balance. |
| `401 invalid_api_key` | The key is missing, wrong or revoked. Ask the user to check `JPVERIFY_API_KEY`; do not retry with guesses. |
| `402 insufficient_credits` (API key) | Stop. Nothing was charged. Tell the user to top up at https://www.jpverify.com/account/billing. Do not retry. |
| `402` with x402 payment requirements (no key) | Pay only within the approved budget, using the exact amount in the response. |
| `422` | Invalid input; nothing was charged. Fix the input (the error says which field) and call again once. |
| `5xx` / timeout | Not charged (credits are refunded). Retry once later; then report the failure. |

Spending rules:
- Before a batch call, or any plan that will cost more than **$0.50** in total, state the number of calls and the total price and get the user's go-ahead.
- Do not call the same paid endpoint repeatedly for the same input; reuse the result you already have.
- Prices in the endpoint table are per successful call in USD (the same with an API key or x402).

## Example / 呼び出し例 (`POST /v1/jp/companies/resolve`)

  -d '{"name": "Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.", "prefecture": "Kyoto"}'
```

```python

    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['JPVERIFY_API_KEY']}",
             "X-JPVerify-Client": "jpverify/1.2.1"},
    json={"name": "Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.", "prefecture": "Kyoto"},
    timeout=60,
)
print(response.status_code, response.json())
```

x402 (no account):

```bash
# No key: shows the HTTP 402 x402 price; pay with an x402 client and retry with PAYMENT-SIGNATURE.
curl -i -X POST https://api.jpverify.com/v1/jp/companies/resolve \

## Limits and privacy / 制限とプライバシー

- Results are a **public-registry pre-check** with the source and as-of date of the data. They are not KYB, AML or sanctions screening, and not legal, tax or accounting advice. A "not found" does not mean the entity does not exist or is risky.
- If `manual_review_required` is true or a status is ambiguous, show the evidence to the user and let them decide; do not decide on their behalf.
- Only send data the user is entitled to process. JPVerify takes fields, not files; do not send personal details (names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses) that a check does not need.
