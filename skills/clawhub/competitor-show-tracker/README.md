# Competitor Show Tracker — OpenClaw Skill

> Rank upcoming trade shows by how many companies in your competitive set are listed as exhibitors.

**Best for**: B2B teams comparing event priorities, mapping competitor show circuits, or deciding where competitive presence matters.

## What It Does

Provide 2–20 competitor company names. The skill uses Lensmor event and exhibitor data to:

- Look up upcoming events associated with each company
- Deduplicate events by Lensmor event ID
- Rank shows by the number of input competitors matched
- Show the matched company entities for each event
- Route the result into event fit scoring, exhibitor research, contact discovery, or budget planning

Coverage varies by event and source. A missing result means no match was found in the queried Lensmor data; it does not prove that a company will not attend or exhibit.

## Cost and Activity Side Effects

Each company lookup that returns at least one event consumes 50 credits. It also records the API search and asynchronously updates the API-key owner's HubSpot `last_search_date`. Empty results do not consume credits. Additional pages are separate chargeable requests when they return results.

The Skill calculates the maximum first-page cost and asks for approval before running.

## Usage

```text
Track Siemens, ABB, Schneider Electric, Rockwell Automation, and Bosch Rexroth.
Which upcoming industrial shows have the highest competitor concentration?
```

```text
Compare the 2026 show circuits for our five main warehouse-automation competitors.
Only include events in Europe and North America.
```

```text
Which shows are at least three of these competitors exhibiting at during the next 12 months?
```

## Output

The default response includes:

1. Input companies and date range
2. Ranked event table with `matched / total` competitor counts
3. Detail cards for events with two or more matches
4. Gaps, incomplete pages, and unmatched companies
5. Suggested next steps based on the highest-ranked events

See the [fictional industrial automation example](examples/industrial-automation-show-circuit.md).
