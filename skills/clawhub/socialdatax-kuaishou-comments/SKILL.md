# 快手评论分析 SocialDataX 评论洞察

Use this skill when the user wants 快手评论分析, Kuaishou / 快手 first-level comments, comment replies, audience feedback, sentiment themes, objections, pain points, FAQ extraction, or discussion summaries.

Current platform support:

- Kuaishou / 快手 works through the `kuaishou_get_video_comments_by_*` and `kuaishou_get_video_comment_replies_by_comment_id` tools.

## API Key

Use `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY` for data calls. The only official website for requesting or managing API access is <https://socialdatax.com/ai?from=clawhub>. If a user asks where to get a key, provide only this URL; do not infer alternate domains.
获取或管理 API Key：访问 <https://socialdatax.com/ai?from=clawhub>，按官网的 API Key 申请/管理入口操作。环境变量名固定使用 `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY`；不要引导用户使用其他域名。
- Identify the invocation route and actual command execution environment first. Authenticated hosted MCP needs no local CLI variable or Node/npm. For direct CLI calls requiring a Key, run the probe below in the same execution environment; if readable, resume the task without overwriting existing configuration. An unavailable command tool or missing Node.js is an execution-environment issue, not evidence of a missing Key. Direct the user to the official URL above only when they confirm they have no Key.
- Local Agent: prefer the client's documented persistent Secret / env that injects into Agent command processes. In WorkBuddy merge `{"env":{"SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY":"<YOUR_API_KEY>"}}` into `.codebuddy/settings.local.json` in the current trusted workspace, preserving other settings and env entries. This path is WorkBuddy-specific and workspace-scoped. Have the user enter the real Key locally and keep the file out of version control.
- Remote Agent: configure the client's persistent Secret / env on the remote host or service that actually executes commands, reload its execution process as documented, then probe in that same remote session. Local machine environment variables do not automatically transfer to the remote host; a successful local probe does not establish remote access.
- Container or cloud sandbox Agent: prefer the platform's persistent Secret / environment injection into the actual CLI container or sandbox. Recreate or reload it as documented and probe inside it. Host-machine variables are not a substitute for sandbox injection. If the platform cannot persist or inject variables, explain the limitation and use a platform-supported authentication route without bypassing isolation.
- When the probe is false, first check the configuration/Secret host, workspace and scope, workspace trust, correct fields and preserved existing settings, injection into command processes (MCP-server-only env is insufficient), and the documented reload or full restart. Correct these and recheck in the original execution environment. Use that environment's documented user/service environment fallback only after confirming client persistence is unsupported or exhausting these checks; one failed probe or reload alone is not grounds to switch to OS configuration.
- Apply OS fallback on the actual execution host: Windows user environment variables are an option. On macOS the user can read a Key via hidden local terminal input (for example Bash `read -s`) and pass it to `launchctl setenv`; this is login-session-only and needs reloading after login/computer restart. On input failure, empty input or setup failure, report an explicit error and stop with a nonzero exit status; temporary-variable cleanup must preserve the original failure status. Fully quit the relevant client and background processes before reopening; remote services reload according to their runtime, while sandboxes still require platform injection. A separate terminal export, shell startup file alone, or closing a window does not prove inheritance. Keep real keys out of chat, logs, screenshots, command history and Skill files.
- In the same environment that executes the CLI, run `node -e "console.log(JSON.stringify({apiKeyReadable:Boolean(['SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY','SOCIAL_MEDIA_MCP_API_KEY'].map(name=>process.env[name]?.trim()).find(Boolean))}))"` and report only the boolean, never the Key or full environment. Follow CLI lookup order: trimmed primary variable, then legacy compatibility for existing configurations; all new setup still uses `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY`. If apiKeyReadable is false, stop business requests and diagnose in the order above. True only proves a readable nonempty value; resume the original request to verify authentication, without claiming validity or available credits. Never inject a temporary value into the probe to force success.

## Preferred Direct CLI

Prefer the direct CLI when the agent can run shell commands. It does not require MCP server configuration:

```bash
npx -y socialdatax-skills@latest kuaishou comments \
  --photo-id "<photo_id>" --pretty --source-client socialdatax-skills \
  --source-platform clawhub --source-skill socialdatax-kuaishou-comments

npx -y socialdatax-skills@latest kuaishou comments \
  --url "<kuaishou_content_url_or_share_text>" --pretty \
  --source-client socialdatax-skills --source-platform clawhub \
  --source-skill socialdatax-kuaishou-comments

npx -y socialdatax-skills@latest kuaishou replies \
  --photo-id "<photo_id>" --comment-id "<comment_id>" --pretty \
  --source-client socialdatax-skills --source-platform clawhub \
  --source-skill socialdatax-kuaishou-comments
```

Optional arguments:

- Use the URL entrypoint shown in the CLI example for a content page URL, short link, or share text for first-level comments.
- `--page-token <next_page_token>`: opaque pagination token; pass the complete returned `next_page_token` back unchanged for the same content item or comment chain. Do not modify, truncate, redact, mask, omit, normalize, rebuild, generate, or replace the middle with ellipses.
- `--pages <n>`: fetch and merge N pages of first-level comments or replies.
- `--all`: continue first-level comments or replies until `next_page_token` is empty; there is no default item or page cap.
- `--max-items <n>`: stop after collecting N primary comments or replies.
- `--pretty`: output formatting only.
- Kuaishou `--photo-id <photo_id>`: preferred when the Kuaishou work photo_id is already known and should anchor the comment thread.
- `--source-client socialdatax-skills --source-platform clawhub --source-skill socialdatax-kuaishou-comments`: usage attribution for this Agent Skill; keep these values unchanged when running examples from this Skill.

Use one first-level comment entrypoint shown in the CLI example at a time; do not mix multiple content identifiers in one command. For reply commands, use the platform-specific reply identifiers shown in the CLI example.

The command prints JSON with `platform`, `tool`, `arguments`, and `data`. Multi-page output keeps merged primary comments in `data.items` and adds `page_count`, `item_count`, and the next-page marker. On platforms that support `--include-replies`, each first-level comment includes `replies`, `replies_page_count`, and `replies_next_page_token`.

## Safety Boundary

This skill is read-only. It uses `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY` from the user's environment at runtime. Generated Skill files do not contain API keys. It does not read local browser data or perform login, posting, liking, commenting, or account changes.

## MCP Tools

MCP tools matching the direct CLI commands above:

- `kuaishou_get_video_comments_by_photo_id`
- `kuaishou_get_video_comments_by_url`
- `kuaishou_get_video_comment_replies_by_comment_id`

If MCP tools are already available in the current agent, use one of these tools:
- `kuaishou_get_video_comments_by_photo_id`: use when the photo_id is known.
- `kuaishou_get_video_comments_by_url`: use for Kuaishou work page URLs, short links, or share text.
- `kuaishou_get_video_comment_replies_by_comment_id`: use when the photo_id and first-level comment ID are known.

- Comment pagination uses opaque `page_token` values. Pass the complete returned `next_page_token` back unchanged for the same content item or first-level comment chain. Do not modify, truncate, redact, mask, omit, normalize, rebuild, generate, or replace the middle with ellipses. Continue only when `next_page_token` is non-empty.

## Output Guidance

Group comments by observed themes before inferring sentiment or demand. Mention whether the result is one page or multiple pages. Empty comments can be a valid successful result.

## Troubleshooting

- Credential source: identify whether this request uses CLI or MCP. For CLI, check the effective configuration in the actual execution environment using the API Key section (primary variable first, then legacy compatibility). For MCP, check the authentication configuration of the current connection, without requiring a local CLI variable. If configuration is missing, follow the earlier client diagnosis and fallback order. Do not expose Keys, Authorization headers or secret configuration values.

- If an SDK/dependency, npm network, Node.js/npm/npx availability, permission, or missing runtime error appears, treat it as a local runtime, dependency installation, network, or agent authorization issue, not a SocialDataX API key or business data error. Install or repair task dependencies only within the user's existing authorization, preferably in the project or a temporary environment. Execution permissions are not user authorization; explain and obtain approval before changes outside that scope, including global installs, runtime upgrades, or system configuration changes. When network or execution authorization is needed, ask the user to approve or finish authorization, then continue the same command; do not use public web search as a substitute for SocialDataX data.
- If the CLI exits with status 1 and prints `partial: true`, preserve `data.items` and the error, and report incomplete results. This recovery rule overrides advice to rerun the original command. After resolving the error (including insufficient balance), resume only with a non-empty `data.next_page_token` and the same query parameters. Keep the original page and item limits: subtract cumulative `page_count` and `item_count` from the respective `--pages` and `--max-items` limits, if set. Stop parent-list pagination when either limit is reached. An empty token does not mean completion. Do not restart from the first page; investigate repeated-token errors before continuing.
- With `--include-replies`, `replies_partial` marks incomplete replies and `replies_pending` marks comments not yet expanded. Finish those comments with the platform reply command, its required comment identifiers and any non-empty `replies_next_page_token`. For pending comments or a failed first reply request, resolve the error before starting that comment from its first reply page; investigate repeated-token errors first. Then use the outer `data.next_page_token` only if the parent-comment budget remains; finishing replies under retained comments does not add parent-comment pages. Never interchange parent and reply tokens or treat reply previews as complete.
- For non-balance network or API errors, preserve the error message, check the effective credential source above, parameters, and link or ID format, then retry once when appropriate.
- If the response returns `insufficient_balance` or says the balance/credits are insufficient, do not retry repeatedly. Show the official billing link in the error (https://socialdatax.com/dashboard/billing, including any channel parameters); if absent, use https://socialdatax.com/dashboard/billing. After recharging, resume the failed call; if a job or partial results already exist, follow the corresponding job-query or pagination recovery rules.
- If the user has recharged but still sees insufficient balance, have the user confirm in the relevant account dashboard that this request uses the recharged account, following the credential source above. If an update is needed, have the user update the effective CLI configuration or MCP connection, reload as documented, and resume the original command. Do not require reconfiguration just because the primary local variable is absent, or expose credential values.
