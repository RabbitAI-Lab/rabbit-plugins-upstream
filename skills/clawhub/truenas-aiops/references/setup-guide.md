# truenas-aiops setup & security guide

> Mock-validated only — not yet validated against a live TrueNAS SCALE appliance.

## 1. Install

```bash
uv tool install truenas-aiops
```

## 2. Create a TrueNAS API key

In the TrueNAS SCALE web UI: **Credentials → API Keys → Add**. Copy the key
(shown once). truenas-aiops sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` against the
REST API base `https://<host>:<port>/api/v2.0`.

## 3. Onboard

```bash
truenas-aiops init
```

The wizard collects (non-secret) connection details into
`~/.truenas-aiops/config.yaml` and stores the API key **encrypted** into
`~/.truenas-aiops/secrets.enc`. Example config:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: nas1
    host: 10.0.0.30
    port: 443
    verify_ssl: false          # self-signed lab certs only
    api_path: /api/v2.0
```

## 4. Non-interactive use (MCP server / CI / cron)

Export the master password so the encrypted store can be unlocked without a
prompt:

```bash
export TRUENAS_AIOPS_MASTER_PASSWORD='your-master-password'
```

## Credential security

- The API key is **never** written to disk in plaintext. It lives only in
  `~/.truenas-aiops/secrets.enc`, encrypted with Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC),
  the key derived from your master password via scrypt. Only a per-store random
  salt and the ciphertext are on disk (chmod 600); the master password itself is
  never stored.
- A legacy plaintext env var `TRUENAS_<TARGET_NAME_UPPER>_APIKEY` is still
  honoured as a fallback with a deprecation warning — migrate with
  `truenas-aiops secret migrate` (it imports then renames the old `.env`).
- The key is held only in memory during a session and is never logged or echoed;
  exception text and tracebacks are scrubbed of secret-shaped strings before
  being written to the audit log.

## Governance harness state

State lives under `~/.truenas-aiops/` (relocate with `TRUENAS_AIOPS_HOME`):

- `audit.db` — every tool call (SQLite), with its descriptive risk tier and any
  optional approver/rationale annotations
- `undo.db` — inverse descriptors for reversible writes (e.g. `snapshot_create`)
- budget / runaway guard — caps cumulative tool calls and wall-time; trips on
  tight scrub/poll loops

## Verify

```bash
truenas-aiops doctor
```

`doctor` checks the config file, the encrypted store and its permissions,
that an API key is present per target, and (unless `--skip-auth`) connectivity
by hitting `/system/info`.
