# CourtListener research

Search CourtListener's public opinion index and browse its court and judicial
person directories as normalized JSON.

## When to use this skill

- Search public opinions by text.
- Discover courts and retrieve one court record.
- Browse or look up public judicial-person records.
- Build an initial legal-research shortlist before opening primary documents.

## Setup

- Get a Crawlora API key at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=crawlora-skills).
- `export CRAWLORA_API_KEY=sk_your_key_here`
- Requests use `x-api-key: $CRAWLORA_API_KEY` against `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`.

## How it works

Use `/courtlistener/search` for opinion text search, `/courtlistener/courts`
for court discovery/detail, and `/courtlistener/people` for public judicial
person records. Treat results as research leads and verify legal conclusions
against the underlying opinion and applicable jurisdiction.
