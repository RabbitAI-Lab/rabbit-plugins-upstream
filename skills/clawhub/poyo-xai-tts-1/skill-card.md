### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT-0 <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and agents use this skill to prepare PoYo xai-tts-1 text-to-speech requests, choose voice, language, speech tag, and audio output settings, submit trusted payloads, and handle task polling or webhook workflows. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: POYO_API_KEY or authorization headers could be exposed through browser code, logs, screenshots, repositories, or chat output. <br>
Mitigation: Keep the API key in server-side environment variables or a backend secret manager and avoid displaying or logging raw credentials. <br>
Risk: Private scripts, callback URLs, task IDs, or generated audio URLs may contain sensitive workflow or customer information. <br>
Mitigation: Review payloads and callback URLs before submission and avoid logging or sharing private request and result details unless policy allows it. <br>
Risk: The skill submits audio-generation tasks to PoYo when used with a trusted shell and explicit user intent. <br>
Mitigation: Use the submit script only for prepared payloads in a trusted server-side environment after the user confirms live API submission. <br>
