## Authentication

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/authentication

Authentication â

Every request must include the API token in the authentication header. Otherwise, the API returns an error.

The authentication header has the following format:

http
x-api-key : your_api_public_key_here

1

You can authenticate by setting x-api-key to the project's Public Key directly in the request header. (You can find the Public Key in the API Key section of the ComPDF API console.)

## Request workflow

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/request-workflow

Request Mode Guide â

ComPDF API offers three request modes for different business scenarios: synchronous , asynchronous , and pre-signed URL . This page compares them side by side and provides the full calling flow for each one to help you choose the best integration approach.

Overview of the Three Modes â

Dimension Synchronous (Sync) Asynchronous (Async) Pre-signed URL (Pre-signed)

Upload method Direct upload: send the file to ComPDF in one multipart/form-data request Direct upload: send the file to ComPDF in one multipart/form-data request The client uploads directly to object storage through a pre-signed URL, and the file does not pass through the business API

File count Single file (except merge endpoints) Single / multiple files Single / multiple files

Blocking Yes . The server returns only after processing finishes No . Returns taskId immediately No . Returns taskId and the upload address immediately

How to get results The sync response returns downloadUrl directly Poll task status / receive Webhook notifications Poll task status / receive Webhook notifications

Recommended file size Small files up to 10 MB 10 MB ~ 50 MB Large files / batch jobs / browser uploads

Server bandwidth usage High (both directions go through the business gateway) High (upload still goes through the business gateway) Low (upload goes through object storage CDN)

Implementation complexity â Easiest ââ Moderate âââ Slightly more complex (one extra signature step)

Typical scenarios Demos, small tools, instant-feedback pages Background batch jobs, async pipelines Browser/mobile uploads, very large files, cross-region uploads

Selection advice

If you are unsure, start with synchronous , then upgrade to asynchronous / pre-signed as needed.

If the business side should not block and files are relatively large, prefer asynchronous .

If files come from browsers or end users, are often larger than 50 MB, or you want to reduce your own server bandwidth pressure, use pre-signed URL .

Pros and Cons â

Synchronous (Sync) â

Pros

One request gets the result, so the logic is the simplest.

Easy to debug; good for examples and tutorials.

Cons

Processing time equals HTTP wait time, so it is prone to gateway / network timeouts .

Larger files are less stable; batch processing is not supported.

Client threads stay occupied, which limits throughput.

Asynchronous (Async) â

Pros

Returns taskId immediately, so the caller is non-blocking.

Supports batch processing and can work with Webhook callbacks for higher throughput.

Good for backend pipelines and scheduled jobs.

Cons

Uploads still go through the business gateway, so single-request body limits still apply .

Requires an extra "check status / handle callback" step.

Pre-signed URL (Pre-signed) â

Pros

Files are uploaded directly to object storage , bypassing the business gateway, so very large files are supported.

Greatly reduces inbound bandwidth / forwarding pressure on your own server.

Ideal for direct uploads from browsers, mini programs, or mobile apps.

Cons

The call chain is longest (get signature â upload â trigger task â query result).

The client must handle PUT / POST upload protocols.

Call Flow â

1. Synchronous Request Flow â

1 Client starts POST multipart/form-data file + parameter + x-api-key

2 Server processing Finish conversion / parsing task HTTP connection stays open

3 Sync response Returns downloadUrl code / status / taskId

4 Download result Via downloadUrl Link has an expiration time

Key points

One request completes the full "upload + process + return" flow, so the chain is shortest.

Because HTTP long connections are affected by gateway timeouts, we recommend tasks with a single file of 10 MB or less and an expected processing time under 60 seconds.

The sync API supports only one file (except merge endpoints).

See Complete Example for a full runnable sample.

2. Asynchronous Request Flow â

1 Submit task POST uploads files multipart/form-data

2 Return immediately taskId status = TaskWaiting

3 Server processing Async queue scheduling Client can do other work in parallel 4 Polling / callback Query task status or receive Webhook

5 Download result downloadUrl

Key points

You get taskId immediately after upload, so the caller is not blocked.

Query the status through Get Task List / Get Asset Details ; we recommend a polling interval of at least 3 seconds .

Pair it with Webhook Events to receive task-completion notifications and avoid useless polling.

It is well suited for backend batch jobs, overnight jobs, and products where users return later to check the result.

3. Pre-signed URL Request Flow â

1 Create task Get taskId and pre-signed uploadUrl

2 Upload file directly PUT to object storage Bypasses the business gateway

3 Execute task Notify the server Triggered with taskId 4 Server processing Async processing Supports very large files

5 Polling / callback Query task status or Webhook notifications

6 Download result Via downloadUrl Link has an expiration time

Key points

The biggest difference from the async flow is steps 1 and 2 : you first get a pre-signed URL, and the client uploads directly to object storage .

The upload step does not pass through the ComPDF business gateway, so it is not limited by the single-request body size , which makes it ideal for large files / browser uploads.

After you get the pre-signed URL, complete the upload within its validity period (usually 15 to 30 minutes).

The later stepsâ"execute â query / callback â download"âare the same as the async mode.

General Notes â

File download links returned by the API are usually deleted at 24:00 the next day ; please download them in time.

When calling the API, pay attention to the parameter style (query / form / json) and whether the auth header x-api-key is required.

HTTP status 200 means your HTTP request succeeded, not that file processing succeeded ; use the code field in the response body as the business result.

For mainland China access, replace https://api-server.compdf.com/ with https://api-server.compdf.cn/ in all request URLs.

If you want automatic notification when a task finishes, use Webhook Events to avoid high-frequency polling.

## AI overview

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/ai/overview

ComPDF AI Overview â

ComPDF AI provides Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) APIs under the POST /v2/process/idp/* family. These guides explain concepts, request modes, parsing configuration, and extraction schemas. For full field-level API details, see the corresponding API Reference .

Capabilities â

Capability Path Purpose

Document Parsing idp/documentParsing Parse document structure and produce JSON / tagged Markdown with bbox references

Document Extraction idp/documentExtract Extract key fields and table data; supports layout and vision modes

Core concepts â

Task â each parsing or extraction call creates a task and returns task metadata. Sync mode returns the result directly; async and presigned flows require status polling.

Extraction schema â describes the keys and table headers to extract. Both layout and vision modes take one fixed schema via extract_fields . The schema shape is { name, keys, tableHeaders } .

BBox grounding â layout mode can return page and bbox references so you can map results back to the source document.

Recommended path â

Prerequisites

First request: sync extraction

Prerequisites â

Get an API Key â

Sign in to the ComPDF console .

Create or copy a publicKey from the API Key page.

Keep the key secret. Do not commit it to frontend code or public repositories.

Authentication â

All ComPDF AI APIs use the API key in the request header:

http
x-api-key : <your-public-key>

Quick validation:

bash
curl --location ' https://api-server.compdf.com/server/v2/asset/info ' \
--header ' x-api-key: <your-public-key> '

## AI first request

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/ai/first-request

First request: sync extraction â

This example calls POST /v2/process/idp/documentExtract , uploads a file, and extracts fields with mode=vision (the default mode). Both vision and layout modes take one fixed schema in extract_fields ; for layout extraction, explicitly pass mode=layout .

bash
curl --location --request POST ' https://api-server.compdf.com/server/v2/process/idp/documentExtract ' \
--header ' x-api-key: <your-public-key> ' \
--form ' file=@/path/to/handwriting.pdf ' \

Parameter Required Description

file Yes Source PDF, image, or office document

mode No layout or vision ; defaults to vision

extract_fields Yes JSON string of a single schema used by both vision and layout ; an empty schema triggers AI field auto-extraction

enable_grounding No Whether to return bbox grounding, default true ; this field only needs to be passed when using layout mode.

## AI request modes

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/ai/request-modes

Request modes â

AI capability paths stay the same; the request prefix and upload workflow change.

Mode Endpoint example Best for

Sync POST /v2/process/idp/documentExtract Small files and interactive demos

Async POST /v2/processAsync/idp/documentExtract Large files, batch jobs, backend queues

Presigned POST /v2/presignedUrl/idp/documentExtract Direct browser upload to object storage and stricter security requirements

Async polling â

Start polling every 2-5 seconds, then back off for large files or busy queues. Stop after your business timeout and let the user retry later.

State Meaning

processing The task is running

completed The result is ready

failed Check failureCode / failureReason

expired The task or download link has expired

Webhook â

Pass callbackUrl for async tasks if you want the service to notify your endpoint when processing completes. See Webhook events .

result.detail Flat paragraph-level list merging all pages in reading order

result.excel_base64 Base64-encoded Excel output when export format includes Excel

Recommended reading order â

Start with Parse options to understand request parameters such as image_type , content_filter , options_json , and ignore_labels .

Then read Response structure for the top-level JSON contract.

Use Page details when you need to map headings, tables, and footnotes back to page coordinates.

Use Metrics when you are monitoring processing quality or performance.

Parse options â

This page focuses on the request parameters for the parser-style document parsing endpoint. The examples below keep the file upload flow only and use the current public parameter names.

Request parameters â

Parameter Location Type Required Default Description

file form file Yes â Input document file

image_type query string No url How images are embedded in Markdown: url or base64

content_filter query string No all Keep only selected content block types

options_json form JSON string No Built-in defaults Parser configuration merged with the server defaults

image_type â

image_type controls how image content is represented in the Markdown result:

Value Meaning

url Embed image content as accessible URLs

base64 Embed image content inline as Base64

Use url for most frontend and knowledge-base integrations. Choose base64 when you need a fully self-contained Markdown artifact.

content_filter â

content_filter narrows the result to selected block types. Common patterns:

Value Meaning

all Return all content blocks

text Keep only text-related content

table Keep only table-related content

image Keep only image-related content

If your workflow only needs one category, filtering at request time is usually simpler than post-filtering in downstream code.

options_json â

options_json is a JSON string that controls parsing behaviour. Typical options include:

generating a document tree / catalog

merging related table fragments

re-levelling title hierarchy

ignoring headers, footers, footnotes, and similar auxiliary content

Example:

json
{
" applyDocumentTree " : true,
" mergeTables " : true,
" relevelTitles " : true,
" ignore_labels " : [
" number " ,
" footnote " ,
" header " ,
" header_image " ,
" footer " ,
" footer_image " ,
" aside_text "
]
}

ignore_labels â

ignore_labels is typically passed inside options_json to suppress auxiliary block types in the parse output. The supported labels are:

number

footnote

header

header_image

footer

footer_image

aside_text

To keep all supported auxiliary content, pass an empty array explicitly:

bash
--form ' options_json={"ignore_labels":[]} '

1

Recommendations â

For real-time previews, prefer image_type=url to keep payloads smaller.

For search, extraction, or RAG workflows, use content_filter=text or content_filter=table to reduce downstream processing.

For layout-heavy documents, combine document-tree and table-merge options, then inspect the output with Response overview .

## AI parsing metrics

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/ai/parsing-guide/metrics

Metrics â

metrics explains how each page was processed. It is useful for troubleshooting, quality monitoring, and performance analysis.

Common fields â

Returned fields may vary slightly by document and processing path, but common metrics usually include:

Field Meaning

page Page number

dpi Effective or detected processing resolution

angle Page skew or correction angle

duration / cost_time Processing time for the page

width / height Page image dimensions

status Processing status for the page

Why these fields matter â

Low dpi often correlates with weaker OCR quality

A non-zero angle means the page required rotation correction

A high duration often indicates dense tables, large images, or complex layouts

Abnormal status values help you isolate failing pages quickly

Recommended usage â

Review metrics together with result.pages during quality analysis

Aggregate duration values for page-level performance monitoring

Record failing page numbers together with x_request_id for retries and support cases

Troubleshooting tips â

If a few pages have poor text quality, inspect dpi and angle first

If a whole document is slow, look for oversized image pages or dense table pages

If only selected pages fail, compare them with the page structure described in Page details

## AI extraction guide

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/ai/extract-guide

Document extraction guide â

This guide documents the extraction API with both supported modes: vision and layout .

Guide structure â

Modes

Extract schema

Response structure

Modes at a glance â

Mode Best for Notes

vision Handwritten forms, free-layout scans, image-heavy pages Vision-language extraction mode

layout Stable business documents such as invoices, orders, and contracts Structured extraction mode with optional grounding

Recommended reading order â

Start with Modes to understand the differences and selection advice for the two modes

Then read Extract schema to learn how to write extract schema

Finally read Response structure to understand how the returned results carry field values and grounding information

## AI extraction modes

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/ai/extract-guide/modes

Extraction modes â

Intelligent document extraction supports two processing modes through the mode field at the unified endpoint /v2/process/idp/documentExtract . When omitted, the backend defaults to vision . Both modes use the same fixed extract_fields schema input :

mode Description Schema input Best for

vision Vision-language model running independently on each page. Handles handwriting and free-form layouts more robustly. extract_fields

layout Layout-aware integrated extraction. Supports large files, cross-page extraction, and bbox grounding for traceable results. extract_fields

Vision mode ( mode=vision , default) â

extract_fields is the JSON string of a single schema object:

bash
curl --location --request POST ' https://api-server.compdf.com/server/v2/process/idp/documentExtract ' \
--header ' x-api-key: public_key ' \
--form ' file=@/path/to/handwriting.pdf ' \
--form ' mode=vision ' \
--form ' extract_fields={"name":"Form","keys":{"Name":{"prompt":"Applicant name","mapping":null}},"tableHeaders":{}} '

1
2
3
4
5

Layout mode ( mode=layout ) â

layout uses the same extract_fields input â a JSON string of one fixed schema object:

bash
curl --location --request POST ' https://api-server.compdf.com/server/v2/process/idp/documentExtract ' \
--header ' x-api-key: public_key ' \
--form ' file=@/path/to/invoice.pdf ' \
--form ' mode=layout ' \
--form ' extract_fields={"name":"ShipmentList","keys":{"OrderNo":{"prompt":null,"mapping":null},"Consignee":{"prompt":null,"mapping":null}},"tableHeaders":{"Table_1":{"No":{"prompt":null,"mapping":null},"ISBN":{"prompt":null,"mapping":null},"BookName":{"prompt":null,"mapping":null},"Qty":{"prompt":null,"mapping":null}}}} ' \
--form ' enable_grounding=true '

1
2
3
4
5
6

When using layout mode, if you need to map results back to the original text, you can enable the enable_grounding parameter; the returned results will include coordinate information for the text blocks corresponding to the fields, facilitating result tracing and highlighting. Additionally, layout mode supports the same options_json parameter as the parsing feature. See Parse options for details.

How to choose â

Start with layout when the document structure is stable, the file is long, or you need to map results back to the source

Switch to vision when the document is handwriting-heavy, scan quality is uneven, or the page layout is highly free-form

Request examples â

bash
--form ' mode=vision '

bash
--form ' mode=layout ' \
--form ' enable_grounding=true '

Next, read Extract schema .

## AI extract fields

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/ai/extract-guide/extract-fields

Extract schema â

extract_fields is the key input for document extraction. It defines which fields and table headers you want to extract, plus the prompts associated with them.

Base structure â

Both modes use the same single-schema shape:

json
{
" name " : " Invoice " ,
" keys " : {
" Title " : { " prompt " : " Invoice title " , " mapping " : null },
" Date " : { " prompt " : " Invoice date " , " mapping " : null }
},
" tableHeaders " : {
" LineItems " : {
" Item " : { " prompt " : " Item name " , " mapping " : null },
" Amount " : { " prompt " : " Item total " , " mapping " : null }
}

Custom field extraction â fill in keys / tableHeaders to extract a predefined schema.

You can iterate on a schema in the Online Tools site and use its "Export Schema" button to copy the JSON. Paste it directly into extract_fields for both vision and layout modes.

Field reference â

Field Type Meaning

name string Schema name for identification

keys object Scalar key-value fields

tableHeaders object Table field definitions grouped by table name

prompt string Instructional prompt for the model; can be null

mapping string Optional mapping metadata for your downstream system; can be null

When to use keys â

Populate keys when you already know which scalar fields you need, for example:

invoice number

issue date

consignee

contract ID

When to use tableHeaders â

If the target document contains line-item tables, fee tables, or other repeated tabular structures, define them in tableHeaders so the output lands in a more stable format.

{
" name " : " auto " ,
" keys " : {},

Recommendations â

Next, see Response structure for how extracted values and grounding data are returned.

## AI extraction response structure

Source: https://www.compdf.com/guides/api-reference/v2/ai/extract-guide/response-structure

Response structure â

The extraction result can be understood as "field output plus optional grounding data". When enable_grounding is enabled, the response can include bbox references back to the source page.

Top-level view â

The API returns a standard task-level response. The extraction result (fields, tables, pages, etc.) is available in the downloaded file referenced by downloadUrl or fileUrl .

json
{
" code " : " 200 " ,
" msg " : " success " ,
" data " : {
" fileKey " : " <string> " ,
" taskId " : " <string> " ,
" fileName " : " <string> " ,

Field output â

Scalar field results commonly include:

Field Meaning

name / key Field name

value Extracted field value

page Source page number, when returned

bbox Source-page coordinates, especially when grounding is enabled

Table output â

Table-style output is commonly organised as "table name -> rows -> cells". In practice, this usually means:

a table identifier

a list of row records

cell values mapped to the schema-defined headers

If your schema defines tableHeaders , the returned table data usually follows the same header structure, which makes it easier to map into downstream business objects.

the backend attempts to include positional references for extracted fields or table cells. This is useful for:

highlighting extracted values in the source PDF

jumping from extracted results back to the original page

human review and verification workflows

How to use the result â

If you only need values, read fields

If you need line-item detail, read tables

If you need UI highlighting, consume page and bbox together

If you need full context, combine extraction output with documentParsing
