## Publisher:

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Developers and cloud platform engineers use this skill to administer Huawei Cloud UCS clusters with hcloud CLI guidance, including onboarding CCE or self-managed clusters, managing fleet groups, obtaining kubeconfigs, checking quotas, and handling common UCS failures.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: The skill can guide sensitive Huawei Cloud UCS administration, including cluster registration, deregistration, fleet changes, quota checks, and kubeconfig retrieval.

Mitigation: Use a least-privilege IAM user, prefer temporary credentials, confirm every paid or destructive command before execution, and install the skill only for UCS administration use cases.

Risk: Kubeconfig files, access tokens, AK/SK values, and security tokens are sensitive and may grant cluster or cloud access.

Mitigation: Treat generated kubeconfig files and credential values as secrets, avoid printing them in conversation or logs, and rotate credentials according to the organization's policy.
