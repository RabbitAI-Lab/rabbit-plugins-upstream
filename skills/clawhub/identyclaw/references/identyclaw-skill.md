# IdentyClaw ClawHub Skill

**MCP resource URI:** `doc:reference:identyclaw-skill`

Installable workflow skill for OpenClaw agents — complements the HTTP API cheat sheet and the OpenClaw plugin tools (multi-API JWT sessions, HOLA, identity).

## Install

```text
openclaw skills install clawhub:identyclaw
```

**ClawHub page:** [clawhub.ai/identyclaw/identyclaw](https://clawhub.ai/identyclaw/identyclaw)

## Credentials (ClawHub badge)

ClawHub may show **API key required** on the skill page. For IdentyClaw that means an **IdentyClaw Passport** — your NEAR implicit account and Ed25519 signing key — configured once in the OpenClaw plugin (or env vars), the same way you would store a third-party API key. The plugin derives short-lived JWT sessions from that Passport (**per API URL**, including federated hosts via `apiEndpoints` / `apiEndpoint`); public discovery routes work without it.

**Agents:** call `identyclaw_ensure_session` and other `identyclaw_*` tools — **do not** hand-roll curl login.

The **skill** teaches when and how to use IdentyClaw workflows (API session vs HOLA lines; home vs federated APIs). The **plugin** executes API calls and local HOLA signing on the Gateway ([plugin README](https://github.com/discernible-io/openclaw-identyclaw-plugin/blob/main/README.md)). MCP provides **documentation only** — see `doc:reference:mcp-auth-tools`.

**Other runtimes:** Hermes (`hermes-identyclaw-skill/`), IronClaw, NanoClaw, Cursor — host login is first-class; see `doc:reference:agent-frameworks`. Do not treat curl as an OpenClaw fallback.
