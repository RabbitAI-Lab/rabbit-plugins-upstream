# MCP surface

TRAECNclaw exposes one focused Agent surface. There are no tool profiles.

## Protocol and transport

- MCP `2026-07-28`: stateless per-request `_meta`, `server/discover`, typed
  results, structured tool content, server identity metadata, and cache hints.
- MCP `2025-11-25` and `2024-11-05`: legacy `initialize` compatibility.
- stdio: one compact JSON-RPC object per line. `Content-Length` framing is
  accepted only as a migration compatibility path.

MCP contract version 5 below identifies this Skill's frozen 20-tool surface;
it is not an MCP protocol revision. Legacy clients receive compact
`notifications/message` task events. MCP `2026-07-28` removed free-floating
logging notifications, so modern clients intentionally call
`traecn_get_task` when they need a known task's state. The experimental MCP
Tasks extension is not advertised as a stable capability.

| Tool | Required input | Gateway route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `traecn_send_message` | `message` | `POST /api/tasks/submit` |
| `traecn_get_task` | `taskId`; optional `detailLevel` (`result` or `trace`) | `GET /api/task/{taskId}` |
| `traecn_cancel_task` | `taskId` | `POST /api/task/{taskId}/cancel` |
| `traecn_stop_generation` | `conversationId`, `acknowledgeUntrackedWork`, `reason` | `POST /api/trae/stop-generation` |
| `traecn_open_workspace` | `path` | `POST /api/open-project` |
| `traecn_list_models` | none | `GET /api/models` |
| `traecn_select_model` | `model` | `POST /api/switch-model` |
| `traecn_select_mode` | `mode` | `POST /api/switch-mode` |
| `traecn_list_setting_sections` | none | `GET /api/settings/sections` |
| `traecn_list_settings` | `section` | `GET /api/settings/read` |
| `traecn_list_setting_options` | `section`, `label` | `GET /api/settings/options` |
| `traecn_set_setting_toggle` | `section`, `label`, `enabled` | `POST /api/settings/set` |
| `traecn_select_setting_option` | `section`, `label`, `value` | `POST /api/settings/set` |
| `traecn_set_setting_text` | `section`, `label`, `text` | `POST /api/settings/set` |
| `traecn_list_conversations` | none | `GET /api/conversations` |
| `traecn_create_conversation` | none | `POST /api/conversations/manage` |
| `traecn_select_conversation` | `conversationId` | `POST /api/conversations/manage` |
| `traecn_delete_conversation` | `conversationId`, `expectedTitle`, `acknowledgePermanentDeletion` | `POST /api/conversations/manage` |
| `traecn_answer_question` | `answer` | `POST /api/interactions/resolve` |
| `traecn_decide_approval` | `decision`; approve also needs `expectedCommand`, `acknowledgeRisk`, `reason` | `POST /api/interactions/resolve` |

`traecn_send_message` accepts only `message` and optional `conversationId`.
Set workspace, model, mode, and conversation through their focused tools. New
conversations are explicit and messages otherwise stay in the selected chat.

After message acceptance the gateway owns persistence, external and local
queues, recovery, completion checks, notifications, routine questions, safe
command approvals, and keep/revert gates. Agents do not wait, poll, acknowledge
events, run preflight, or recover work. `traecn_get_task` is an optional
explicit read, not a polling instruction. Its default `detailLevel: "result"`
returns only the final answer; use `detailLevel: "trace"` when a failure or
unexpected result requires the visible execution process for diagnosis.

Settings tools form a second level: list visible sections, then list only one
section's items and their `controlType`. List dropdown options before selecting
one. Each write tool maps to one exact UI control operation, while the gateway
opens settings and restores chat automatically.

Only strict read-only command chains are approved automatically: `cd`; basic
inspection with `pwd`, `ls`, `rg`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, or
`stat`; read-only Git status/diff/log/show/branch/rev-parse/ls-files; and
unredirected `echo`. Shell redirection/substitution, network, package, process,
privilege, project-script, mutating find/sed, ripgrep preprocessor, and Git
external-diff/textconv forms never auto-approve. Unknown commands go to Agent
review. Automatic approvals and every high-impact Agent decision are written
to the local append-only security audit log.

The direct stop action works only in Solo mode and only when its supplied ID
still matches the active conversation. It requires an acknowledgement that the
visible generation may be untracked plus an audit reason. Conversation delete
requires an inactive target, exact listed title, and permanent-deletion
acknowledgement; it has no recovery path. Unsafe-command approval revalidates
the exact currently visible command and records the risk acknowledgement and
reason before clicking.
