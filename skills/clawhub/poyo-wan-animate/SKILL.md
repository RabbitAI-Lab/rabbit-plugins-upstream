Use this skill for Wan Animate jobs on PoYo. It helps agents prepare character animation and character replacement payloads, submit async tasks, and explain polling or webhook follow-up.

## Use When

- The user explicitly mentions Wan Animate, `wan-animate-replace`, or `wan-animate-move`.
- The task needs a character image animated by a source video or a character replacement workflow.
- The workflow needs PoYo async task submission, task status polling, or callback URL guidance.

## Model Selection

- `wan-animate-replace`: use when replacing a character in a source video with the character from a target image.
- `wan-animate-move`: use when animating a character image with motion from a source video.

## Key Inputs

- `video_url` is required and points to the source video.
- `image_urls` is required and must contain exactly one target image.
- `resolution` is optional and supports documented output values.
- `callback_url` is optional and useful for production queues.

## Security Rules

- Treat `POYO_API_KEY` as a secret.
- Keep PoYo API keys in server-side environment variables or a backend secret manager.
- Never place an API key in browser code, frontend bundles, public repositories, logs, screenshots, or chat output.
- Do not make live API calls unless the user explicitly asks and provides a safe server-side environment.
- Do not submit private likeness images, private videos, private prompts, or private callback URLs unless the user trusts PoYo and the callback receiver.

## Execution

- Read `references/api.md` for endpoint details, model ids, common fields, example payloads, and polling notes.
- Use `scripts/submit_wan_animate.sh` only when the user wants to submit a prepared JSON payload from a trusted shell.
- If the user only needs a curl example, adapt one from `references/api.md`.
- After submission, report the returned `task_id` clearly so follow-up polling is easy.

## Output Expectations

When helping with Wan Animate, include:

- chosen model id
- whether the request uses character replacement or character animation
- final payload or concise parameter summary
- source video and target image roles
- selected resolution when relevant
- returned `task_id` if a request was actually submitted
- next step: poll status or wait for webhook
