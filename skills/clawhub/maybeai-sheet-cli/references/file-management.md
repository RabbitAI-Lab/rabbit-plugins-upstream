## 1. When to use this

Read this document when the task involves uploading, importing, searching, copying, renaming, deleting, sharing, or exporting MaybeAI spreadsheets.

## 2. Basic conventions

- Base URL defaults to `https://a-play-be.maybeai.cn`
- Auth comes from `MAYBEAI_API_TOKEN`
- Most follow-up commands use `--doc-id <document_id>` or `--url <sheet_url>`
- `mbs workbook import` creates a new workbook from a local file or remote source; `mbs worksheet import --strategy create` imports worksheets into an existing workbook
- `mbs workbook delete --doc-id <document_id> --yes` soft-deletes an existing workbook; use `--dry-run` to preview the request

- After import succeeds, record:
  - `document_id`
  - `uri`

## 3. Engine selection

MaybeAI Sheet routes worksheets through either Sheet mode or Base mode:

- `sheet` is the workbook-style mode for Excel layout, styles, formulas, merged cells, and workbook semantics.
- `base` is the mode for large table-like data, SQL, large row counts, large cell counts, append/upsert, and Base-native reads/writes.

Best practice:

- Choose engine per worksheet for mixed workbooks; do not force the whole workbook to Base Mode just because one sheet is large.
- Inspect the file structure and choose engines before creating a workbook.
- Use `mbs workbook import ./file.xlsx --engine auto` when the backend should detect engines per worksheet.
- Use `mbs workbook import "https://static.example.com/file.xlsx" --engine auto` to create a workbook from a remote Excel URL. This routes through `/api/v1/excel/import_by_url`; it does not append into an existing workbook.
- Use comma-separated engines by worksheet index when the target is known, for example `--engine "base,sheet,sheet,base"`.
- Use `mbs workbook import ./orders.csv --engine base` or a public Google Sheet URL with `--engine ...` for import-source flows.
- Use `mbs worksheet import <source> --strategy create --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID>` for an existing workbook. Omit `--source-worksheet-name` to import all previewed worksheets/tabs, repeat it to select multiple sources, and use `--target-worksheet-name` only for one selected source.
- Prefer Base Mode for a worksheet when it has more than 5,000 rows and is one flat table whose data columns each have one datatype except the header and missing values. The older high-cell-count preference still applies when the data is one homogeneous table.
- If the task depends on Sheet-specific workbook fidelity, use `sheet` for those worksheets.
- Use Sheet mode for reports, summaries, dashboards, formulas, merged cells, styled workbooks, or worksheets with multiple separated tables. For example, `L1_广州瑞鹏_详细` in the LLM cost analysis workbook has two tables in one worksheet and should use Sheet mode.
- A small single table such as `L1_客户集中度_帕累托` can use Base Mode or Sheet mode; auto may choose Sheet mode because the sheet is not large.
- For chart-heavy dashboards, small flat `Data_*` worksheets may still need Base Mode because chart SQL will query them. Choose `base` for SQL source sheets and `sheet` for dashboard/cover/summary sheets; use an explicit engine list only when the worksheet order is known.
- Explicit `--engine base` is strict. If the worksheet is not Base-compatible, expect an unsupported-layout import error. Use `--engine auto` when fallback to Sheet mode is acceptable.
- Do not push large table data through row-object JSON writes; import the file with `engine=base` instead.
- Base import owns datatype normalization during import. The CLI should only pass intent through `--engine`; parsing to same datatype should be enabled by backend default.
- After import, verify the response top-level `engine`, plus per-worksheet `worksheet_engines` entries such as `worksheet_name`, `index`, `requested_engine`, `selected_engine`, `final_engine`, `fallback_reason`, `reason`, and datatype warnings/errors.
- For import-source appends into existing workbooks, single-worksheet commits should expose `target.gid` and `target.worksheet_name`; multi-worksheet commits keep top-level `target` workbook-scoped, so inspect `result.worksheets`.
- For raw Base-backed surface imports, target table names default to `R_{sanitized_worksheet_name}`. Omit `--source-worksheet-name` to import all source worksheets, or repeat it to select worksheets. Successful `worksheet import` stdout plus `--verify` is the creation evidence.
- If shape confirmation is needed after a batch raw-surface import, resolve one representative table with `table inspect`, then sample it by `table_id`.
- For Maybe Sheet-to-Maybe Sheet imports, use `--transfer-mode values` for Base raw surfaces or `--transfer-mode native` to preserve each source worksheet's registered engine and supported fidelity. Native transfer does not accept `--engine`.

### Base preprocess contract

Do not implement datatype detection or conversion inside `maybeai-sheet-cli`.
For Base-backed imports, the Base backend should preprocess worksheet columns before
materializing them into the Base storage layer:

- infer one target datatype per column from non-header values
- allow empty cells and common missing-value markers such as `n/a`
- coerce values that can safely convert to the inferred datatype
- keep or report values that cannot convert instead of silently corrupting data
- prefer Base Mode when a worksheet has more than 10,000 rows and the columns can be normalized

When changing this behavior, update and test the Base backend source, then
verify through the local routed runtime described in
`/Users/dengwei/work/ai/maybeai-uni/docs/maybeai_sheet/debugging-runtime.md`:

```bash
cd <base-backend-repo>
just run

cd /Users/dengwei/work/ai/maybeai-uni/mcp/maybeai-sheet-cli
uv run mbs --base-url http://localhost:7011 workbook import ./mixed-workbook.xlsx --engine auto
uv run mbs --base-url http://localhost:7011 workbook inspect --doc-id <DOC_ID> --output json
uv run mbs --base-url http://localhost:7011 worksheet list --doc-id <DOC_ID> --output json
```

The verification target is the routed path `mbs -> play-be -> Base backend`,
not a direct CLI-only unit test. Also use Base backend tests such as
`go test -v ./...` and the composite router test asset referenced by
`debugging-runtime.md` when the change affects engine selection or registry
routing.

## 4. Core file commands

### Import a mixed workbook with engine autodetect

Use autodetect first when the workbook has both table-like and Excel-layout worksheets:

```bash
mbs workbook import /absolute/path/to/file.xlsx --engine auto
```

Expected response should include the selected engine for each worksheet. If that
field is missing, run `mbs workbook inspect --doc-id <DOC_ID> --output json`
and `mbs worksheet list --doc-id <DOC_ID> --output json`, then verify the
returned workbook and worksheet engine details.

### Import a remote Excel URL into a new workbook

Pass a public HTTPS Excel URL as the positional source:

```bash
mbs workbook import "https://static.example.com/imports/report.xlsx" --engine auto
mbs workbook import "https://static.example.com/imports/report.xlsx" --filename "Board Pack.xlsx" --engine sheet
mbs workbook import "https://static.example.com/download?id=123" --source-type xlsx --filename report.xlsx --engine base
```

This path calls `POST /api/v1/excel/import_by_url` with `file_url`, the resolved
`filename`, and `engine`. `--filename` is optional. Resolution order is the
explicit option, the decoded URL path basename, then `upload.xlsx`.

Remote Excel URL import only creates a new workbook. Do not combine it with
`--doc-id`, `--url`, `--uri`, worksheet selection flags, `--preview-only`, or
`--transfer-mode native`. Use exactly one of `sheet`, `base`, or `auto`; the remote
route does not support comma-separated per-worksheet engines. Explicit
`excel` forwards the URL directly to the Excel import service. `auto` and
`table` first download the workbook for worksheet planning before routing it
to the selected engine, so their request cost includes that planning download.

### Import CSV, TSV, or Google Sheet into a new workbook

CSV/TSV uploads and public Google Sheet URLs use the import-source preview +
commit flow:

```bash
mbs workbook import ./orders.csv --engine base
mbs workbook import ./orders.tsv --engine sheet
mbs workbook import "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit#gid=0" --engine base
mbs workbook import "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit#gid=0" --source-worksheet-name "1店" --worksheet-name "Store 1" --engine sheet
mbs workbook import ./orders.csv --preview-only --output json
```

When no explicit source worksheet/tab is selected for a new workbook, the CLI
sends `selections: []` and lets the backend import all previewed worksheets/tabs.
When selecting one Google tab, prefer `--source-worksheet-name`; use
`--candidate-id` only to disambiguate duplicate backend candidate ids.

### Import local files or Google Sheet tabs into an existing workbook

Use this when the target should gain a normal worksheet, not a raw `R_*`
Base-backed surface:

```bash
# Omit --source-worksheet-name to import all previewed worksheets/tabs.
mbs worksheet import --strategy create ./report.xlsx --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --engine sheet
mbs worksheet import --strategy create ./orders.csv --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --engine base
mbs worksheet import --strategy create "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit#gid=0" --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --engine sheet

# Pass one --source-worksheet-name to import one source worksheet/tab, optionally renamed.
mbs worksheet import --strategy create ./report.xlsx --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-worksheet-name "联盟" --target-worksheet-name "联盟导入" --engine sheet
mbs worksheet import --strategy create ./report.xlsx --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-worksheet-name "联盟" --target-worksheet-name "联盟导入" --engine base
mbs worksheet import --strategy create ./orders.csv --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-worksheet-name orders --target-worksheet-name Orders --engine base
mbs worksheet import --strategy create "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit#gid=0" --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-worksheet-name "1店" --target-worksheet-name "Store 1" --engine sheet

# Repeat --source-worksheet-name to import multiple selected source worksheets/tabs.
mbs worksheet import --strategy create ./report.xlsx --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-worksheet-name "联盟" --source-worksheet-name "订单" --engine base
mbs worksheet import --strategy create ./orders.tsv --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-worksheet-name orders --source-worksheet-name refunds --engine base
mbs worksheet import --strategy create "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit#gid=0" --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-worksheet-name "1店" --source-worksheet-name "2店" --engine sheet
```

For Excel files, `--source-worksheet-name` is the source worksheet returned by
`import_worksheet_preview`. For CSV/TSV/Google import sources, `--source-worksheet-name`
selects the source worksheet/tab name from preview when importing into an
existing workbook. If any requested worksheet/tab does not exist, the CLI fails
before commit/data import and prints the available worksheet names.
`--target-worksheet-name` controls the new worksheet name in the target workbook
and is only valid when exactly one source worksheet/tab is selected. If omitted,
the backend/CLI uses the source worksheet/tab's suggested worksheet name.

### Replace data rows from JSON while keeping headers

Use the unified worksheet import entry point for a full data refresh of one
existing worksheet:

```bash
mbs worksheet import ./rows.json \
  --strategy replace \
  --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> \
  --worksheet-name Students \
  --verify
```

The JSON file must be a non-empty array of objects whose keys match the target
worksheet headers. This strategy calls `/api/v1/excel/update_data_keep_headers`,
keeps row 1 and column order, preserves formula columns by default, and clears
stale data rows. Use `--dry-run` for preflight validation; it cannot be combined
with `--verify`. JSON replace does not accept `--engine`, `--transfer-mode`, or
source worksheet selection options.

### Natively import worksheets from another Maybe Sheet workbook

Use this when the target should receive real worksheet copies rather than
value-materialized `R_*` tables:

```bash
# Copy selected worksheets. Mixed Base Mode and Sheet mode selections are supported.
mbs worksheet import \
  --strategy create \
  --transfer-mode native \
  --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> \
  --source-doc-id <SOURCE_DOC_ID> \
  --source-worksheet-name "工作表3" \
  --source-worksheet-name "工作簿1" \
  --verify \
  --output json

# Copy every source worksheet.
mbs worksheet import \
  --strategy create \
  --transfer-mode native \
  --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> \
  --source-doc-id <SOURCE_DOC_ID> \
  --verify \
  --output json
```

Native flow:

1. Read source `/api/v1/excel_v2/worksheet/metadata` once.
2. Validate repeated `--source-worksheet-name` values, or select all metadata items.
3. Derive `base` or `sheet` from each worksheet's `data_engine`/source metadata.
4. Call `/api/v1/excel/copy_worksheet` once per worksheet.
5. With `--verify`, read target worksheet metadata once and verify final name,
   gid, and engine. The operation result also reports the copied `rows` count;
   use that count as the copy-completeness evidence for large Base worksheets.

Do not pass `--engine`; it is selected internally per worksheet. Use
`--target-worksheet-name` only for one selected worksheet. The backend may
rename a conflict to `Name (2)`, and the CLI reports that final name. Empty
worksheets are valid native copies. This mode supports Base Mode -> Base Mode and Sheet mode ->
Sheet mode only; a mixed logical workbook is allowed, but no worksheet is
converted between engines.

Native copy uses the CLI HTTP timeout, which defaults to 30 seconds. For large
worksheets, pass `--timeout 600`. If a timeout names a worksheet, do not rerun
the full batch immediately: the backend may still complete after the client
disconnects. Inspect target worksheet metadata/listing first, then retry only
the unconfirmed worksheet with explicit `--worksheet-name`. Use `--verbose` to
print the active worksheet index and engine before each copy.

### Import source worksheets into raw Base-backed surfaces in another workbook

Use `worksheet import --strategy create --transfer-mode values` for cross-workbook worksheet -> raw surface creation when
the target should become an `R_*`-style Base-backed table:

```bash
mbs worksheet import --strategy create --transfer-mode values --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-doc-id <SOURCE_DOC_ID> --source-worksheet-name "1店" --verify
mbs worksheet import --strategy create --transfer-mode values --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-doc-id <SOURCE_DOC_ID> --source-worksheet-name "1店" --source-worksheet-name "2店" --verify
mbs worksheet import --strategy create --transfer-mode values --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --source-doc-id <SOURCE_DOC_ID> --verify
```

Target table names default to `R_{sanitized_worksheet_name}`. If
`--source-worksheet-name` is omitted, the CLI calls `/api/v1/excel_v2/worksheet/metadata`
for the source workbook and imports all returned worksheets. If multiple
`--source-worksheet-name` values are provided, the CLI validates them against source
metadata before importing, so missing names fail before partial creation and
print the available worksheet names.

`values` is the compatibility default, so existing commands may omit it. This
path only accepts omitted or `--engine base`, reads source
`FORMATTED_VALUE`, and does not preserve formulas or Sheet formatting.

Treat successful stdout plus `--verify` as the creation proof. Do not follow
that with repeated per-table reads. If the workflow needs a quick shape check,
resolve one representative table by name, then sample it by native ID:

```bash
mbs table inspect --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --table-name R_OrderLines_Store1 --output json
mbs table sample --doc-id <TARGET_DOC_ID> --table-id <TABLE_ID> --limit 2 --output table
```

### Import with explicit per-worksheet engines

The comma-separated list matches worksheet index order:

```bash
mbs workbook import /absolute/path/to/file.xlsx --engine "base,sheet,sheet,base"
```

Use this when worksheet 1 and 4 are Base-compatible flat tables but worksheet
2 and 3 require Sheet workbook fidelity.

For dashboards, a common pattern is:

```text
Cover, Dashboard -> sheet
Data_KPI, Data_Trend, Data_Platform, Data_Quarter -> base when flat and SQL queried
```

Do not guess this list from memory. Use an explicit list only when the source
worksheet order is known; otherwise let `--engine auto` choose per worksheet.

### Import a large table-like file into Base Mode

Use the CLI first:

```bash
mbs workbook import /absolute/path/to/file.xlsx --engine base
```

If an older installed CLI does not expose `--engine`, upgrade the CLI before importing large table files.

Expected success shape:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "documentId": "<document_id>",
  "fileUri": "https://www.maybe.ai/docs/spreadsheets/d/<document_id>",
  "sheets": ["Sheet1"]
}
```

Then verify routing with the CLI:

```bash
mbs workbook inspect --doc-id <DOC_ID> --output json
mbs worksheet list --doc-id <DOC_ID> --output json
```

Confirm the workbook inspection and per-worksheet list output report the intended Base-backed engine details.

### Import a workbook-style file

CLI:

```bash
mbs workbook import ./report.xlsx
```

Use this for Excel/workbook-style imports where layout, styles, formulas,
merged cells, or workbook fidelity matter more than table scale.

### List or search files

Use search when you need to find historical files by keyword.

CLI:

```bash
mbs file list --limit 20
mbs file search --query "q2 forecast" --limit 20
```

### Export

Guidance:

- Prefer `export` when you want the `.xlsx` file directly
- Use `download` when you already have a `uri`

CLI:

```bash
mbs workbook export --doc-id <DOC_ID> --out workbook.xlsx
```

### Copy a workbook

Use workbook copy when you need a new editable document based on an existing
workbook. The backend should preserve worksheet engine topology when possible,
so verify the copied workbook with `workbook inspect` and `worksheet list` before continuing.

```bash
mbs workbook copy --doc-id <DOC_ID> --title "Copy of Workbook"
mbs workbook inspect --doc-id <NEW_DOC_ID> --output json
mbs worksheet list --doc-id <NEW_DOC_ID> --output table
```

## 5. Sharing and permissions

Use the `mbs share ...` commands in [permission-sharing.md](permission-sharing.md).

## 6. Recommended flows

### Bring a new file into the system

1. Inspect approximate row count and workbook intent
2. If sheets are mixed, use `mbs workbook import ./file.xlsx --engine auto`
3. If all sheets are table-like and rows > 10,000, use `mbs workbook import ./file.xlsx --engine base`
4. If worksheet engines are known, use `mbs workbook import ./file.xlsx --engine "base,sheet,sheet"`
5. Otherwise use `mbs workbook import ./file.xlsx`
6. Record `document_id` from JSON output
7. `mbs workbook inspect --doc-id <DOC_ID>` and `mbs worksheet list --doc-id <DOC_ID>`
8. Sample only when needed for shape confirmation; use at most one representative `table sample` or `table sample` after resolving its table ID

### Bring in a chart-heavy dashboard workbook

1. Identify SQL source worksheets, usually flat `Data_*` tabs.
2. Identify canvas/layout worksheets, usually `Dashboard`, cover, and summaries.
3. Import with `--engine auto`, or use an explicit worksheet-index list such as `--engine "sheet,base,base,sheet"` when the source order is known.
4. `mbs workbook inspect --doc-id <DOC_ID>` and `mbs worksheet list --doc-id <DOC_ID> --output table`
5. Verify source `Data_*` sheets report Base Mode when chart SQL will query them.

### Bring a large table-like file into the system

1. Use `mbs workbook import ./file.xlsx --engine base`
2. Record `documentId` and `fileUri`
3. Run `mbs workbook inspect --doc-id <DOC_ID> --output json` and
   `mbs worksheet list --doc-id <DOC_ID> --output json`.
4. Confirm response top-level `engine` and per-worksheet `worksheet_engines`, or Base-backed engine details in the inspection/list output
5. If needed, resolve `mbs table inspect --doc-id <DOC_ID> --table-name <REPRESENTATIVE_TABLE_NAME>`, then use `mbs table sample --doc-id <DOC_ID> --table-id <TABLE_ID> --limit 2 --output table`.

### Batch raw-surface import with probe budget

1. Prepare the family-level import plan or source list.
2. Run `mbs workbook import ... --verify`.
3. Treat successful stdout plus `--verify` as the creation evidence.
4. Do not loop over each created table with native `schema`, `sample`, or `read` calls.
5. If shape confirmation is needed, resolve and sample at most one representative Base table per family.

### Export before delivery

1. Finish all writes
2. `mbs range read --output table` or `mbs table sample` on key ranges
3. `mbs workbook export --doc-id <DOC_ID> --out workbook.xlsx`

### Reuse a historical file

1. `mbs file search --query "<keyword>"`
2. If copying is needed, use `mbs workbook copy --doc-id <DOC_ID> --title "<NEW_NAME>"`
3. Edit the selected workbook
