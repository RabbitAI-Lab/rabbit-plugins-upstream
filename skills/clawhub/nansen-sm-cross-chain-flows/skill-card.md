## Description:

Compares smart-money token flows across chains to identify possible capital rotation.

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

## Publisher:

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Analysts and other users compare a token's smart-money net flows across chains to spot potential capital rotation over 24-hour and 7-day periods.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Authenticated research calls may consume credits or trigger wallet-authorized x402 payments.

Mitigation: Confirm CLI trust, payment policy, and spending limits before running calls, particularly across multiple chains.

Risk: Research could proceed with an unintended or invalid authentication state.

Mitigation: Select an API key or saved browser session explicitly, check authentication status, and stop if authentication fails.
