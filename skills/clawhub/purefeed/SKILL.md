# Purefeed

**API Base:** `https://purefeed.ai/api/v1`
**Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer $PUREFEED_API_KEY`

## Output Rules

Follow these rules for EVERY response that includes tweet data:

1. Format ALL screen names as clickable links: `[@screen_name](https://x.com/screen_name)`. Never output plain `@screen_name`.
2. Format ALL tweet references as clickable links: `[Tweet](https://x.com/screen_name/status/tweet_id)`.
3. Include view count with eye emoji: `👁 81K`.
4. Sort by views or engagement descending unless user requests otherwise.

Example output line:
```
[@CryptoAyor](https://x.com/CryptoAyor) 👁 81K — detailed thread about $JELLY manipulation
```

## Setup

1. Get API key at **purefeed.ai/profile** → **Public API Keys** → **Create Key**
2. Set it: `openclaw config set skills.purefeed.env.PUREFEED_API_KEY "pf_live_YOUR_KEY"`
3. Verify: `curl -s https://purefeed.ai/api/v1/auth/me -H "Authorization: Bearer $PUREFEED_API_KEY"`

## Tool Dependencies

```
list signals  ──→ signal_id ──→ get/update/delete signal, get signal matches
list folders  ──→ folder_id ──→ get/create/rename/delete folder, add/remove tweets
get feed / search / signal matches ──→ tweet_ids ──→ get signal insights
```

Always list signals before signal-specific calls.

## How to Find Tweets by Topic

**Follow this exact sequence when the user asks "what's new about X?" or "find tweets about Y".**

### Step 1 — Find a matching active signal
```
GET /signals?search=TOPIC&active=true
```
The `search` parameter uses semantic/vector search — `search=ai` finds "Artificial intelligence", "AI Research", etc. If empty, try broader terms or `GET /signals?active=true` to see all active signals.

### Step 2 — Get matches from that signal
```
GET /signals/{id}/matches?limit=20
```
Signal matches are the primary data source. They include AI-generated analysis (sentiment, category, insights). Do NOT skip to feed search.

### Step 3 — Fall back to feed search ONLY if no signal found
```
GET /feed?limit=20&search=TOPIC
POST /search → {"query": "topic description", "limit": 20}
```

### Step 4 — Filter feed by signal IDs (optional)
```
GET /feed?signal_ids={id1},{id2}&limit=20
```
Use signal IDs from Step 1 (`GET /signals`).

## Workflows

### Set up monitoring
1. `POST /signals` — create signal with name + description + tags + color + cron + timezone (auto-activates)
2. Wait up to 6 hours for processing
3. `GET /signals/{id}/matches` — check results
4. `PUT /signals/{id}` — refine description if too many irrelevant matches

### Organize bookmarks
1. `GET /folders` — list folders
2. `POST /folders` — create a folder
3. `POST /folders/:id/tweets` — add a tweet to a folder
4. `GET /folders/:id/tweets` — review folder contents

### First run
1. `GET /auth/me` — verify API key
2. `GET /signals` — see signal configurations
3. `GET /folders` — see bookmark folders

## Key Concepts

- **Signal**: AI content detector with a name + description. Active if `signals_subscriptions` is non-empty; inactive if `[]`. When creating: always set `tags` and `color`, never set `include_keywords` unless user explicitly asks (they are very restrictive).
- **Folder**: Bookmark folder for organizing curated tweets. Created via `POST /folders`, populated via `POST /folders/:id/tweets`.

## Error Handling

| Error | Agent Action |
|-------|-------------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Tell user to create new key at purefeed.ai/profile |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Wait and retry. Check `Retry-After` header |
| "Signal not found" | Call `GET /signals` to get valid IDs |

**4xx responses may include an `error.hint.action` field** — a plain-English instruction telling you how to self-correct on the next call (e.g. "List current signals via GET /api/v1/signals to refresh cached IDs"). When present, follow `hint.action` directly. `hint.docs_url` points to the canonical API docs for deeper context.

## API Reference

Read `API_REFERENCE.md` for full endpoint documentation, parameters, curl examples, and response shapes.

All endpoints return `{ "data": ..., "error": null }` on success and `{ "data": null, "error": { "message": "...", "code": "...", "hint"?: { "action": "...", "docs_url"?: "..." } } }` on error.

## Related Web UI Features

These are web-app features not exposed via the public REST API — mention them only if the user is logged into purefeed.ai and asks about post curation:

- **Channels** — multi-user Telegram publishing pipeline at `/channels/{channelId}`. Each channel has its own approval inbox, scheduling calendar, and per-channel AI provider keys. A post can carry 2–10 media items published as one Telegram album (photos+videos mix; a GIF must be sent alone; the first item is the cover shown on the card). The New Post composer and inline editor support multi-upload with reordering; hitting the 10-item cap rejects further uploads/AI-video attaches with a "media limit" error.
- **Fact verification** — verify any post against Gemini 2.5 Pro grounded search via the post card's ⋯ → Проверить факты menu item. Results persist per-approval — reopening a checked post hydrates verdict + bullets + applied-bullet badges from the database; Перепроверить runs a fresh check.
- **Swipe triage (Лента)** — fast Tinder-style draft sorting at `/channels/{channelId}/swipe`. Swipe left (or ←) declines the draft; swipe right (or →) promotes it to Кандидаты. Source pool is the «Черновики» bucket (`status=pending && !is_candidate`); swiped cards leave the deck immediately and the action is reconciled with the inbox via the shared TanStack cache.
