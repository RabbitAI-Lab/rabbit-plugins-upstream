name: automate-feishu-invoice-approval
description: Scaffold, configure, validate, run, and maintain a Feishu/Lark invoice approval bot that uses Codex vision, validates buyer headers, auto-selects the closest expense category, drafts the approval reason, sends an interactive confirmation card, and submits only after the original uploader confirms. Use for building or troubleshooting Feishu invoice-to-approval workflows, approval form mappings, dry-run tests, card callbacks, and duplicate protection.

# Automate Feishu Invoice Approval

Build a reusable Python service that turns invoice images sent to a Feishu bot into uploader-confirmed expense approvals.

## Core workflow

1. Choose a new or empty target directory. Do not overwrite an existing project.
2. Run `python3 <skill-directory>/scripts/scaffold.py --target <target-directory>`.
3. Read [references/setup.md](references/setup.md) before configuring a first deployment or changing an approval definition.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and `config/approval_mapping.example.json` to `config/approval_mapping.json`.
5. Fill the buyer name, buyer tax ID, approval code, expense option IDs, and approval widget IDs. Never put an app secret in `.env` or the mapping file.
6. Configure the Feishu application credential with `scripts/setup-lark.sh`.
7. Run the generated project's tests and validation:

   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
   PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m invoice_approval_bot.cli validate
   ```

8. Start with `BOT_DRY_RUN=true`. Send representative invoices and verify extraction, buyer-header rejection, category selection, reason generation, confirmation-card callbacks, and duplicate handling.
9. Set `BOT_AUTO_SUBMIT=true` and `BOT_DRY_RUN=false` only when the user explicitly authorizes real approval creation.
10. Run `scripts/run.sh` under the user's preferred supervisor. Read [references/operations.md](references/operations.md) for status meanings and incident checks.

## Safety invariants

- Limit file reads and writes to the Skill bundle and the user-selected target project. Shell access is required to run the scaffolder, tests, validation, `codex`, and `lark-cli`; environment access is limited to the variables declared in frontmatter and the generated project's `.env`.
- Reject an invoice before confirmation when either the normalized buyer name or normalized buyer tax ID differs from the configured values. Tell the uploader which field failed.
- Never create a real approval until the original uploader clicks **Submit** on the confirmation card.
- Accept card actions only from the uploader and only for the matching card and source message.
- Keep dry-run enabled during initial setup, approval-form changes, and callback changes.
- Preserve SQLite idempotency and invoice-fingerprint duplicate protection.
- Do not publish or log `.env`, app secrets, approval credentials, real invoice images, extracted invoice JSON, SQLite databases, open IDs, or organization-specific approval/widget IDs.
- Do not invent approval widget or radio-option IDs. Obtain them from the target approval definition.

## Customization

- Edit the JSON Schema enum in `config/invoice-output.schema.json` and the matching `expense_type_options` object together when changing expense categories.
- Keep mapping values on supported paths such as `invoice.expense_category_value`, `invoice.approval_summary`, `invoice.total_amount_number`, and `approval_file.attachment_code`.
- Update or add unit tests whenever changing mappings, normalization, card actions, or submission state transitions.
- Keep the bundled confirmation gate unless the user explicitly requests a different approval policy and understands the risk.

## Bundled resources

- `scripts/scaffold.py` copies a clean, reusable project template.
- `assets/template/` contains the Python service, tests, schema, and safe example configuration.
- `references/setup.md` covers Feishu application and approval mapping setup.
- `references/operations.md` covers dry-run promotion, records, statuses, and troubleshooting.
