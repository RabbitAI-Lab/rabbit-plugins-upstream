# QSR Ghost Inventory Hunter

**v1.0.0 · McPherson AI · San Diego, CA**  
[mcphersonai.com](https://mcphersonai.com)

QSR Ghost Inventory Hunter helps restaurant and franchise operators identify unaccounted inventory loss by comparing theoretical recipe usage against actual inventory movement.

It is designed to answer a simple but expensive question:

**If the product was ordered and received, but never sold or logged as waste, where did it go?**

This skill investigates the gap between:
- sales volume
- recipe yields
- inventory counts
- deliveries received
- waste tracking

It helps determine whether missing product is most likely caused by:
- over-portioning
- unrecorded waste
- prep error
- receiving discrepancy
- theft

## What it does

This skill walks an operator through a focused inventory variance investigation for one item at a time.

It:
- calculates theoretical product usage from sales mix and recipe portions
- calculates actual product usage from beginning inventory, deliveries, and ending inventory
- identifies the variance between the two
- converts the variance into estimated dollar loss
- helps diagnose the most likely cause
- generates a structured ghost inventory report
- tracks patterns across repeat investigations

## Best use cases

Use this skill when:
- food cost is elevated but the cause is unclear
- a high-cost item runs out faster than expected
- inventory counts do not match what should be on hand
- waste tracking is incomplete
- receiving accuracy is in question
- the operator suspects shrink or product loss

## Example investigation

Example:

- 400 turkey sandwiches sold
- 3 oz turkey per sandwich
- theoretical usage = 1,200 oz = 75 lbs

Inventory movement:

- starting inventory = 100 lbs
- deliveries = 50 lbs
- ending inventory = 60 lbs
- actual usage = 90 lbs

Result:

- ghost inventory = 15 lbs
- if turkey costs $4.20/lb, estimated unexplained loss = $63.00

That gives the operator a concrete starting point for investigation instead of a vague feeling that food cost is too high.

## Why it matters

Most operators know when food cost is off.

Fewer know whether the cause is:
- line over-portioning
- prep waste
- unlogged spoilage
- short deliveries
- or actual theft

This skill helps narrow that down with numbers.

## Works best with

This skill pairs well with:

- **qsr-food-cost-diagnostic** — identifies that a food cost variance exists
- **qsr-weekly-pl-storyteller** — helps connect inventory loss back to the weekly financial story
- **qsr-daily-ops-monitor** — helps surface daily execution issues that may be driving repeated variance
