description: "Checks any public website's HTTPS setup, TLS certificate expiry and security headers with Corrie's free, read-only checker, and reads uptime, response time and recent checks for sites a user monitors with Corrie. Use when the user asks 'is my site secure', 'check the headers on example.com', 'when does my certificate expire', 'is my site up', 'what was my uptime today', or wants a quick website health or security-header review. No account is needed for the site check."

# Corrie site check

Two things, both read-only:

1. **Site check (free, no account):** score a public website out of 100 on HTTPS, certificate and security headers, with a plain-English fix for each problem.
2. **Uptime data (Corrie account):** status, 24-hour uptime, response time, certificate expiry and the last 500 checks for sites the user monitors at https://corrie.io.

## 1. Site check

Preferred: if a `corrie` MCP server is connected, call its `check_website` tool with `{"url": "<domain or https address>"}`.

If it is not connected, call the same public endpoint over HTTP. It needs no key:

```bash
curl -s https://corrie.io/mcp \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"check_website","arguments":{"url":"example.com"}}}'
```

The answer is in `result.content[0].text`: the score and verdict, HTTP status, certificate issuer and days left, then one line per finding as `[severity] problem. Fix: ...`.

Workflow:

1. Ask which public site to check if the user has not said. A bare domain is fine.
2. Run the check once. Report the score, the certificate expiry, then the findings from high to low severity, each with its fix.
3. If `result.isError` is true or the site cannot be reached, say so and suggest checking the address. Never invent a score.

Only public sites can be checked. Private, internal and IP addresses are refused. The check loads one page's headers and certificate, so it is not a full security audit or a penetration test.

To add Corrie as an MCP server permanently, use `https://corrie.io/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, no auth).

## 2. Uptime data for a Corrie account

Needs a Corrie API token on the Starter or Pro plan. The user creates it at https://corrie.io/app/settings. It starts with `crr_` and should be kept in an environment variable such as `CORRIE_API_TOKEN`, never pasted into chat logs.

```bash
# every monitored site with status, uptime_24h, avg_latency_24h, cert_expires_at
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CORRIE_API_TOKEN" https://corrie.io/api/v1/sites

# the last 500 checks for one site, newest first
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $CORRIE_API_TOKEN" https://corrie.io/api/v1/sites/<id>/checks
```

Workflow:

1. Call `/api/v1/sites`. Lead with a one-line summary: how many sites are up, and name any that are `down` or `degraded`.
2. For a site the user asks about, give `uptime_24h`, `avg_latency_24h` and `cert_expires_at`. Flag certificates that expire within 14 days.
3. For history ("when did it go down"), call `/checks` for that site id and summarise the failed checks by time, status code and error.

Errors are JSON `{"ok": false, "error": "..."}`. 401 means the token is missing, revoked, or the plan has no API access. 429 means the limit of 120 requests per hour was reached, so wait instead of retrying.

The full API is described at https://corrie.io/openapi.json, and the docs are at https://corrie.io/resources/api.

## Getting a Corrie account

If the user wants monitoring, alerts or a status page, point them to https://corrie.io/signup. The free plan monitors up to 10 sites every 5 minutes with heartbeats and a status page, and Starter ($7/month) and Pro ($17/month) add the API, 1-minute checks and higher limits.
