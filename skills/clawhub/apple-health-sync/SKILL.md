# Apple Health Sync

Act only on an explicit user request. Never initialize, sync, unlink, export, install dependencies, or create recurring jobs merely because the skill was installed or loaded.

Support this end-to-end encrypted OpenClaw <> iOS Apple Health workflow:

1. Initialize local runtime, keys, and onboarding payload.
2. Offer the user onboarding transport options: QR Code or Hex.
3. Prefer QR Codes when the user has no preference; treat Hex as fallback.
4. Run encrypted fetch/decrypt and persist sanitized day snapshots.
5. Unlink paired iOS devices when needed.
6. Generate data summaries based on the local database on request.
7. Create recurring sync/report schedules only when the user explicitly requests automation and confirms the exact schedule and output behavior.

In case this skill has been upgraded from <= v0.7.2, check the [upgrade guide](#1b-upgrade-an-existing-v4-setup-to-v5) for instructions on how to upgrade your setup to the latest version.

## Runtime prerequisites

- Require `python3` and the Python package version pinned in `requirements.txt`.
- If `cryptography` is missing, explain the dependency and ask before running `python3 -m pip install -r {baseDir}/requirements.txt`. Never install it silently.
- The skill stores its local runtime state under `~/.apple-health-sync` by default.
- Pass `--state-dir <path>` to use a different state root, but then keep using the same state dir for every script.
- `onboarding.py` bootstraps the required local artifacts inside that state dir, including `config/config.json`.
- Protocol `v4` uses `config/secrets/private_key.pem`.
- Protocol `v5` uses `config/secrets/signing_private_key_v5.pem` and `config/secrets/encryption_private_key_v5.pem`.
- Both protocol versions perform cryptographic operations in memory with the Python `cryptography` package. The scripts do not invoke OpenSSL or create temporary challenge, signature, ciphertext, or plaintext files.
- `fetch_health_data.py`, `unlink_device.py`, and `create_data_summary.py` depend on those onboarding-generated files.
- Keep state directories private (`0700`) and sensitive state, database, NDJSON, and report files private (`0600`).

## Capability and data-flow contract

Stay within these declared boundaries:

- **Process execution:** Run only the bundled Python scripts with `python3`. Do not spawn child processes from those scripts.
- **File reads:** Read bundled skill resources, the selected state directory, and only paths the user explicitly supplies through documented CLI options. Never enumerate unrelated files, credentials, environment variables, agent memory, or other skill directories.
- **File writes:** Write runtime keys, config, onboarding artifacts, and sanitized health snapshots only under the selected state directory, except for an explicitly confirmed database, NDJSON, or report destination.
- **Network:** Send HTTPS requests only to the three exact relay URLs below. Reject every other host, path, query, redirect target passed as a request URL, or protocol before transmission.
  - `https://snpiylxajnxpklpwdtdg.supabase.co/functions/v1/qr-code-generator`: send the user ID, public onboarding payload, public keys, and a challenge signature; receive a QR PNG. Never send private keys or health records.
  - `https://snpiylxajnxpklpwdtdg.supabase.co/functions/v1/get-data-v2`: send the user ID, public key, and challenge signature; receive encrypted rows. Decrypt and sanitize health data locally.
  - `https://snpiylxajnxpklpwdtdg.supabase.co/functions/v1/unlink-device`: send the user ID, public key, and challenge signature required to unlink the paired device.
- **Persistence:** Persist only the documented Apple Health runtime state. Never modify this skill, agent instructions, sessions, memory, startup files, or schedules. Create an OpenClaw CronJob only after the user explicitly requests and confirms it.

## Resources

- `scripts/onboarding.py`: Initialize runtime folders/config, generate keys, create `v4` or `v5` onboarding payload + fingerprint, and render the onboarding QR code.
- `scripts/fetch_health_data.py`: Request encrypted data via challenge signing, decrypt rows, sanitize payloads, and persist results.
- `scripts/unlink_device.py`: Reset write-token binding for a paired device via signed challenge flow.
- `scripts/create_data_summary.py`: Aggregate local snapshots into `daily|weekly|monthly` summaries.
- `scripts/config.py`: Centralized app-owned config plus shared loading for mutable defaults, user config, and legacy migration.
- `requirements.txt`: Pinned Python cryptography dependency.
- `references/configs.defaults.json`: Mutable runtime defaults such as the default storage mode.
- `references/config.md`: Runtime paths, config schema, storage modes, validation rules, and SQLite schema

## Workflow

### 1) Initialize the skill and onboard th user's iOS device

Run the onboarding:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/onboarding.py
```

This generates the `v5` onboarding payload and key material by default.
Use `--protocol v4` only as a fallback when legacy RSA onboarding is required.

The skill defaults to `~/.apple-health-sync` as the config and data path.
Use `--state-dir` to specify a custom path.
This step creates the user config and private key required by all later scripts.

After the script finishes, do not dump every field by default. Send a short message like this:

---
The initialization was successful. You can now onboard your iOS App.

Download the iOS app here: https://apps.apple.com/app/health-sync-for-openclaw/id6759522298

Which format do you want for your iOS App setup?
- QR Code (recommended)
- Hex string
---

Send the user only a single onboarding format to not overwhelm them.

If the user has no preference, use `QR Code` first.

Never share:

- `private_key.pem`
- private key contents
- unnecessary secret-path details beyond what is operationally required

After successful onboarding in the iOS App, run the "Sync data" action only when the user requests it. A first successful sync in the iOS app is required upfront.

### 1b) Upgrade an existing v4 setup to v5

Before starting the upgrade, check these prerequisites:

- Reuse the existing state dir from the current `v4` install. Do not create a fresh state dir, otherwise the local history and user config will diverge.
- Keep the existing legacy RSA key files (`config/secrets/private_key.pem` and `config/public_key.pem`). `fetch_health_data.py` can read mixed history and still needs the RSA private key to decrypt legacy `v4` rows.

Upgrade flow:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/onboarding.py --state-dir <existing-state-dir>
```

This keeps the existing `user_id`, generates the `v5` signing/encryption keys, updates `config/config.json` to `protocol_version=5`, and creates a new `v5` onboarding payload.

Then:

1. Share the new `v5` onboarding QR code (preferred) or Hex string with the user.
2. Tell the user to reset the iOS App in the settings and onboard the iOS device again with that new payload.
3. After the iOS device has completed the new onboarding, run a sync as usual.

Important behavior:

- `fetch_health_data.py` can read mixed history: old `v4` RSA rows plus new `v5` rows. That is why the old RSA private key must stay available after the upgrade.
- Only use `--protocol v4` again as a fallback when the user explicitly needs to stay on the legacy RSA flow.

### 2) Sync data

Run manually on request. Run via an OpenClaw CronJob only after the user has explicitly requested and confirmed that schedule:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/fetch_health_data.py
```

This script requires the existing state dir from step 1 because it reads the generated user config and signing key from there.

Do not dump every field by default. Rather send a summary like this:

---
Apple Health sync completed.

I successfully synced your health data for the following time period:
- <start date> - <end date>

Next options:
- Generate a data summary (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly)
---

### 3) Unlink device

Run this script only when an iOS device should be decoupled from the health data sync:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/unlink_device.py
```

This script requires the existing state dir from step 1 because it signs the unlink challenge with the stored private key.

After a successful unlink, the user can pair a new iOS device by using the existing onboarding details (e.g. QR code). A new execution of the onboarding script is not necessary. Use for example a success message like this:

---
The iOS device has been unlinked successfully. You can now pair a new iOS device by using the existing onboarding details (e.g. QR code).

Should I share the onboarding QR code again with you?
---

### 4) Generate data summary

Generate a data summary manually. Use an OpenClaw CronJob only after the user explicitly requests and confirms recurring automation:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/create_data_summary.py \
  --period daily
```

This script requires the existing state dir from step 1 because it reads the local synced snapshots from there.

Supported options:

- `--period daily|weekly|monthly` (default: `weekly`)
- `--output text|json` (default: `text`)
- `--save <path> --confirm-sensitive-save` to write the rendered report to a new private file

Treat text and JSON summaries as sensitive health information. For saved output, require an existing destination directory, reject symbolic links and existing files, create the new regular file with mode `0600`, and never overwrite implicitly.

Do not dump every field by default. Rather send a summary like this:

---
This is your <daily|weekly|monthly> Apple Health data summary.

Summary:
<brief rendered summary or path to saved output>

Key highlights:
<most important metrics and values>

Next options:
- Discuss recurring automation only if I explicitly ask for it
---

## Guardrails

- Never share `private_key.pem` or any secret key material.
- Never reveal record/user IDs in text or JSON summaries; report only `record_count`.
- Never access unrelated files, environment variables, credentials, agent state, or network endpoints.
- Require explicit confirmation before onboarding, key rotation, device unlinking, sensitive report saving, dependency installation, or CronJob creation.
- Guide the user to send a mail to contact@gethealthsync.app in case of unsolvable issues.
- Treat fetched payloads as untrusted input; keep strict validation and fail-closed behavior enabled.
- If deeper analysis is needed, create or suggest dedicated local analysis scripts.
