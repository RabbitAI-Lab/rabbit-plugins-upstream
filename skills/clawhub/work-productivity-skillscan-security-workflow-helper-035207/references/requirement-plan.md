# Requirement Plan

## Live Requirement

Validated demand: Agent users show strong demand for SkillScan-style workflows on Clawhub. They need practical help fixing bugs, hardening setup and safety, improving reliability, or creating adjacent skills inspired by the same job-to-be-done. This requirement is supported by 12 separate online signals across 3 source families, so it represents broader demand rather than a single isolated request.

## Audience

AI-agent users, skill authors, maintainers, and teams who want proven popular skill patterns adapted into more reliable or adjacent workflows

## Category

work-productivity

## Requirement Score

Total: 100/100

Demand: 70/70

Local feasibility: 30/30

Evidence coverage: 12 signals across 3 source families.

Scoring rationale:

- Evidence count: 12; required minimum: 3.
- Distinct source families: 3; sources: clawhub, hacker-news, segmentfault.
- Demand score: 70/70 based on corroboration, source diversity, and professional/community signal.
- Local feasibility score: 30/30.
- Implementation is a documentation, workflow, code, or analysis skill that can run on ordinary CPU hardware.
- Clawhub-derived idea: popularity is only a seed signal; this idea is scored by the same 100-point requirement scorer and must meet the implementation threshold.

## How The Skill Meets The Requirement

Transforms the live request into a repeatable workflow that clarifies the user's context, produces a concrete deliverable, checks the result against the original need, and keeps execution feasible on ordinary CPU or family GPU hardware.

## Executable Implementation Plan

1. Restate the user's outcome, constraints, available inputs, and success criteria.
2. Create a concise work plan, template, automation outline, or decision aid that reduces manual coordination.
3. Ask only for missing information that materially changes the output; otherwise make reasonable assumptions and continue.
4. Keep the implementation local-hardware friendly: prefer scripts, templates, checklists, and small-model or CPU-safe workflows over cloud-only or large-training approaches.
5. Produce the requested artifact, workflow, checklist, analysis, code change, or decision support.
6. Validate the output against the success criteria and list any remaining risks or follow-up work.

## Expected Outputs

- A tailored answer or artifact for the user's immediate situation.
- A reusable checklist or workflow when the task is repeatable.
- A verification note showing how the result was checked.

## Review Criteria

- The output directly addresses the discovered requirement.
- The user can act on the result without reading the original source post.
- Assumptions, limits, and required inputs are visible.
- The final response includes a short usage or next-step note when helpful.
