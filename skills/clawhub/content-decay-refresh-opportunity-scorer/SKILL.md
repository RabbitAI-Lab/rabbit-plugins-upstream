## Overview

The **Content Decay & Refresh Opportunity Scorer** is a predictive intelligence module that transforms raw content performance data into actionable refresh recommendations. Rather than simply flagging outdated content, this skill analyzes decay patterns across multiple dimensions—search ranking erosion, engagement velocity, competitive positioning shifts, and factual staleness—then delivers a prioritized list with *specific* refresh actions.

### Why This Matters

Content degrades predictably. As competitors publish updated versions, search algorithms evolve, and audience interests shift, your high-performing content loses visibility and relevance. Manual audits are slow and subjective. This skill automates the discovery process, surfacing which content to refresh first and *exactly what type of refresh* (update stats, expand sections, add recent case studies, reformat for featured snippets, etc.).

### Integration Points

- **Google Analytics 4** — engagement metrics, user drop-off trends
- **Google Search Console** — ranking position tracking, impression/click decay
- **SEMrush / Ahrefs API** — competitor content analysis, backlink decay
- **WordPress REST API** — publish dates, update frequency, content structure
- **Slack** — deliver prioritized refresh lists to editorial teams
- **HubSpot / Marketo** — connect to marketing automation workflows
- **GitHub / GitLab** — version-controlled content repositories

## Quick Start

### Example 1: Audit a Blog Category

```
Analyze my WordPress blog posts from the "Marketing Automation" category.
I have Google Analytics and Search Console connected. 
Score content decay for:
- Ranking position changes (last 90 days)
- Click-through rate decline >15%
- Engagement time drop >20%
- Published date >18 months ago with technical content
Return top 10 refresh opportunities with specific recommendations.
```

### Example 2: Prioritize Competitor-Driven Refresh

```
My top-ranking article on "Email Marketing Best Practices" has been slipping.
Analyze:
1. My ranking for primary keyword (last 180 days)
2. Competitor articles now ranking above me
3. New topics they've covered that I haven't
4. Backlink changes for my URL
Return a refresh strategy with specific sections to expand, 
new case studies to add, and updated stats to incorporate.
```

### Example 3: Bulk Audit with Slack Delivery

```
Score all content published in my /resources directory older than 12 months.
Weight the decay model by:
- 40% search ranking loss
- 30% engagement velocity
- 20% competitor activity
- 10% data staleness (citations older than 2 years)
Identify the 15 highest-priority refresh candidates.
Send results to Slack #content-strategy with severity flags.
```

### Example 4: Fact-Based Staleness Detection

```
Audit my whitepapers and case studies for outdated claims.
Flag content that:
- References statistics older than 3 years
- Mentions deprecated product versions
- Contains regulatory info affected by 2024 law changes
- References old market research/analyst reports
Prioritize by audience impact: show which pieces affect sales/conversion most.
```

## Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Decay Analysis

Scores content across four independent decay vectors:

**Search Ranking Decay**
- Tracks keyword position history (via Google Search Console API)
- Calculates position loss velocity (steep vs. gradual decline)
- Detects ranking cliff events (algorithm updates)
- Compares against competitor movement for same keywords
- Flags pages with lost featured snippet status

**Engagement Decay**
- Analyzes engagement time trends (GA4 time_on_page metric)
- Calculates drop-off rate by cohort (new visitors vs. returning)
- Detects bounce rate inflation
- Compares current engagement to page's historical peak
- Identifies which traffic segments show lowest engagement

**Competitive Positioning Shift**
- Maps which competitors now rank above you
- Analyzes their content freshness, word count, backlink authority
- Identifies gap topics they've published that you haven't
- Tracks their content update frequency
- Reveals search intent drift (user behavior changes)

**Factual & Data Staleness**
- Extracts citations and publication dates from content
- Flags statistics older than configurable threshold (default: 3 years)
- Cross-references with news/regulatory databases for invalidation
- Detects deprecated product/feature references
- Identifies market research older than refresh cycle

### 2. Prioritized Recommendation Engine

Generates specific, actionable refresh actions:

```
[PRIORITY SCORE: 8.7/10]
Content: "Email Marketing ROI Guide" (12 months old)
URL: /resources/email-roi-2024
Current Ranking: Page 1, Position 7 (keyword: "email marketing ROI")
Decay Drivers:
  • Ranking slipped from Position 2 → Position 7 (lost 5 spots in 90 days)
  • Engagement time down 32% vs. 6-month average
  • HubSpot published competing article ranking Position 3 (published 2 months ago)
  • 68% of cited statistics are 4+ years old

Recommended Refresh Actions (Priority Order):
1. UPDATE STATISTICS (High Impact)
   - Replace 2020 Statista data with 2024 reports
   - Add current conversion rate benchmarks (update section: "Benchmark Your Performance")
   - Refresh ROI calculation examples with latest email platform pricing

2. EXPAND SECTION (Medium Impact)
   - Add "AI-Powered Subject Line Optimization" subsection (HubSpot has this; you don't)
   - Include new case study from recent client: Q4 2024 campaign achieving 4.2% conversion

3. REFORMAT FOR SNIPPETS (Medium Impact)
   - Create structured data FAQ schema for "How to calculate email ROI?"
   - Convert "Quick Calculation Formula" to comparison table format

4. LINK & AUTHORITY (Low Impact)
   - Add 3 new outbound links to 2024 research (improves freshness signals)
   - Audit internal links; update 6 broken references to redirects

Estimated Impact: Refresh should recover 2-3 ranking positions within 30 days.
Time to Complete: 3-4 hours. Effort Level: Moderate.
```

### 3. Batch Audit Mode

Process 50-500 pieces of content with decay scoring and automated prioritization:

- Generate CSV export with all URLs, scores, and recommended actions
- Filter by minimum decay score, publication date, traffic volume
- Group by recommended action type (statistics, expansion, reformat, etc.)
- Export as individual refresh briefs for editors
- Schedule periodic rescores (weekly/monthly) to track improvement

### 4. Custom Decay Weighting

Adjust the scoring formula to match your priorities:

```json
{
  "decay_weights": {
    "search_ranking_loss": 0.40,
    "engagement_drop": 0.30,
    "competitor_activity": 0.20,
    "data_staleness": 0.10
  },
  "ranking_loss_sensitivity": 1.2,
  "engagement_threshold_percent": 15,
  "data_age_threshold_years": 3,
  "competitor_tracking_enabled": true,
  "min_traffic_for_analysis": 50
}
```
