## 2. The 6 AI Pricing Models

### 2.1 Model Comparison

| Model | Description | AI Use Case | Pros | Cons | AI Product Example |
|------|------|-----------|------|------|-----------|
| **Subscription (SaaS)** | Fixed monthly/annual fee | AI-Enhanced products | Predictable revenue | Wide usage variance | GitHub Copilot $10/mo |
| **Usage-Based** | Per API call / Token / count | AI APIs / Platforms | Fair & transparent | Unpredictable costs | Modern LLM APIs (GPT-4.1/Claude/Gemini) |
| **Outcome-Based** | Per task completed by AI | Agent / Automation | Strong value alignment | Complex metering | Intercom Fin $0.99/resolution |
| **Hybrid** | Base fee + usage | AI-Native SaaS | Balances stability + elasticity | Complex pricing | Notion AI $10 + overage |
| **Value-Based** | Based on value created for customer | Vertical AI | ROI directly visible | Requires value quantification | Healthcare AI / per diagnosis |
| **Freemium** | Free features + paid premium AI | Individual → Enterprise conversion | Fast acquisition | Uncertain conversion rate | ChatGPT / Cursor |

### 2.2 Model Selection Decision Tree

```
Is AI functionality core to the product?
├── Yes → Is AI cost share high (>30%)?
│       ├── Yes → Is customer usage variance high?
│       │       ├── Yes → Hybrid Pricing (base + usage)
│       │       └── No → Usage-Based Pricing
│       └── No → Subscription Pricing (AI as value-add feature)
└── No → AI is auxiliary
          └── Subscription (with AI quota) + AI usage overage fees
```

## 3. Token Economics

### 3.1 Cost Structure Analysis

| Cost Item | Calculation Method | Monthly Cost | Share |
|--------|---------|---------|------|
| LLM API Calls (Input) | $X/1M tokens × monthly input volume | | |
| LLM API Calls (Output) | $Y/1M tokens × monthly output volume | | |
| Embedding API | $Z/1M tokens × monthly volume | | |
| Reranker API | | | |
| Vector Database | Storage + queries | | |
| GPU / Inference Servers (if self-deployed) | | | |
| Other AI Infrastructure | | | |
| Non-AI Costs (servers / bandwidth / labor) | | | |
| **Total Cost** | | | |

### 3.2 Per-User Token Consumption Model

| User Type | Daily Interactions | Avg Input per Interaction | Avg Output per Interaction | Daily Tokens | Monthly Tokens | Monthly Cost |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Light User | | | | | | |
| Standard User | | | | | | |
| Heavy User | | | | | | |
| Power User | | | | | | |

### 3.3 Cost Optimization Levers

| Optimization Lever | Estimated Savings | Implementation Complexity | Side Effects |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Prompt Caching | 30-50% | Low | Only effective for repeated prefixes |
| Model Routing (simple → small model) | 40-60% | Medium | Complex cases may be misrouted |
| Semantic Caching (similar queries) | 20-40% | Medium-High | Not suitable for time-sensitive needs |
| Output Token Limits | 10-20% | Low | May truncate useful output |
| Fine-tuned Small Model Replacing Large Model | 50-80% | High | Requires training data + maintenance |
| Batch Processing (non-real-time scenarios) | 50% | Medium | Increased latency |

### 3.4 AI Gross Margin Calculation

```
AI Gross Margin = (Revenue - AI Inference Cost - AI Infrastructure Cost) / Revenue × 100%

Example Calculation:
- Monthly Fee: $30/user
- Monthly Token Consumption: 500K input + 100K output
- Model Cost (GPT-4o): $2.5/1M input + $10/1M output
- Monthly AI Cost: 500K/1M × $2.5 + 100K/1M × $10 = $1.25 + $1.00 = $2.25
- AI Gross Margin: ($30 - $2.25 - $3 infrastructure) / $30 = 82.5% ✅

Target: AI Gross Margin > 60%
```

| Usage Limits Over Feature Limits | "You've used today's free quota" is better than "This feature requires payment" |
| Individual → Team Conversion | Free tier cultivates individual users → paid team conversion |

### 6.2 Free Tier Cost Control

| Method | Description |
|------|------|
| Use Cheaper Models | Free uses GPT-4o-mini, Pro uses GPT-4o |
| Lower Token Limits | Restrict context length and output length |
| Delayed / Downgraded Processing | Free requests get lower queue priority |
| Cache-First | Free requests prioritize cached results |
| Ads / Watermarks | Non-paying user outputs carry brand watermark |

Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Model:
Q1: At what price would you consider it too cheap and question quality? → PMC (Point of Marginal Cheapness)
Q2: At what price would you consider it a bargain?                       → PME (Point of Marginal Expensiveness)
Q3: At what price would you start to feel it's expensive?                → IDP (Indifference Price Point)
Q4: At what price would you consider it too expensive to accept?         → OPP (Optimal Price Point)

Optimal price range: IDP ~ OPP
