## v1.1.0 New: Model Selection Strategy

### Model Selection Decision Framework
| Dimension | Closed-source Models (GPT-4.1 / Claude Sonnet 4 / Opus 4.5) | Open-source Models (Llama/Qwen) | Self-developed Models |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Performance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Cost | $$ | $ | $$$$ |
| Data Security | Requires evaluation | Controllable | Fully controllable |
| Customization | Limited | Fine-tunable | Fully customizable |
| Maintenance Cost | Low | Medium | High |
| Go-live Speed | Fast (API) | Medium (Deploy + Fine-tune) | Slow (Training + Deploy) |

### Model Routing Strategy
```
User Request → Classifier Determines
  ├── Simple Q&A → Small Model (GPT-4o-mini / Gemini Flash-Lite / Claude Haiku)
  ├── Complex Reasoning → Large Model (GPT-4.1 / Claude Sonnet 4 / Opus 4.5)
  ├── Specialized Domain → Fine-tuned Model
  ├── Real-time Requirements → Edge-deployed Small Model
  └── Sensitive Data → Privately Deployed Model
```
