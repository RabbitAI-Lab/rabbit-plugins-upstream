## AI PM vs Traditional PM: Deep Cognitive Differences

> Without understanding these 12 differences, there is no real AI product thinking.

| Dimension | AI Product | Traditional Software Product | AI PM's Response |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Output Determinism** | Probabilistic — same input can yield different output | Deterministic — input determines output | Accept non-determinism, design fault-tolerance mechanisms |
| **Quality Metrics** | Multi-dimensional (accuracy/relevance/safety/latency/cost) | Functionally correct / no crashes | Build multi-dimensional evaluation systems |
| **Marginal Cost** | Every inference incurs token costs | Near zero | Incorporate inference costs into product design and pricing |
| **Capability Ceiling** | Model capability determines product ceiling | Code capability determines product ceiling | Deeply understand model capability boundaries |
| **Iteration Speed** | Model upgrade → product auto-upgrades; model degradation → product auto-degrades | Code deployment → product upgrade | Monitor upstream model changes |
| **Failure Modes** | Silent failures (hallucinations, bias, omissions) | Explicit failures (errors, crashes) | Design detection and degradation mechanisms |
| **User Experience** | Users need to learn how to communicate effectively with AI | Users learn fixed operation paths | Design guided AI interaction + fallback paths |
| **Trust Building** | Requires progressive trust (low-risk first, then high-risk) | Trust is relatively stable once established | Design transparency, explainability, controllability |
| **Security Boundary** | Multi-dimensional attack surface (Jailbreak/Injection/Data Poisoning) | Traditional network security + application security | Requires AI-specific security protection layers |
| **Competitive Moat** | Data flywheel > Algorithm moat > First-mover advantage | Network effects / Switching costs / Brand | Design data flywheel from Day 1 |
| **Regulatory Environment** | Rapidly evolving (EU AI Act / Generative AI Administrative Measures) | Relatively stable | Continuously track global AI regulatory dynamics |
| **Pricing Model** | From per-seat → per-usage / per-outcome / hybrid | Per-seat / Per-feature | Design pricing models aligned with user value |

> **AI Product Essential Formula: Product Value = (AI Capability Increment − User Trust Discount) × User Usage Depth × Data Flywheel Acceleration ÷ Inference Cost Coefficient**

## AI Product Technology Fundamentals: 10 Concepts Every PM Must Know

> You don't need to write code, but you must understand these concepts to communicate effectively with ML engineers.

### 1. How Large Language Models (LLMs) Work (PM Perspective)

```
Input Text → Tokenization → Embedding (Vectorization)
→ Transformer Layers (Attention Mechanism + Feed-Forward Networks) → Token-by-Token Generation → Output Text

What PMs need to know:
- LLMs are essentially "next-token predictors," not search engines, not databases
- Attention Mechanism: the model "attends to" different parts of the input
- Generation Process: each step selects the highest-probability next word; random sampling is also possible
```

### 2. Token & Token Economics

| Concept | What PMs Need to Know |
|------|------------|
| Token Definition | The smallest text unit the model processes. Chinese ≈ 2-3 characters/token, English ≈ 0.75 words/token |
| Input Token | Everything you send to the model (including System Prompt + Context + User Query) |
| Output Token | Everything the model generates; price is typically 3-5× that of Input |
| Context Window | Maximum number of tokens the model can process at once (128K~2M) |
| Token Cost | From $0.075/M (Gemini Flash) to $60/M (o1 reasoning output) — an 800× gap |

### 3. Model Parameters (7B/70B/405B...)

```
Parameter count ≈ the model's "brain capacity"
- 7B-13B: suitable for simple tasks, low latency, on-device deployment
- 70B: mainstream choice balancing capability and cost
- 405B+: strongest capability, highest cost, suitable for complex reasoning

Key misconception: more parameters ≠ necessarily better. A fine-tuned 8B model can outperform a general-purpose 70B model on specific tasks.
```

### 4. Inference vs Training

| Dimension | Training | Inference |
|---|------|------|
| What it does | Lets the model learn from data | Lets the model produce output |
| Cost | Extremely high (7B ≈ $100K, 70B ≈ $1M+, 405B ≈ $10M+) | Per-token billing |
| Who does it | Model vendors / in-house teams | Every time a user uses it |
| PM Focus | Is fine-tuning needed? Is there enough data? | Cost and latency per call? |

### 5. Embedding

```
Embedding = Converting text/images/audio into fixed-length numeric vectors
Vector → Store in vector database → Semantic search (similarity retrieval)

Core Value: enables AI to "understand" semantics rather than matching keywords
"Contract expiration" and "Agreement termination" → very close in embedding space → both can be retrieved
```

### 6. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

```
RAG = Retrieval + Generation

User Question → Retrieve relevant content from knowledge base → Inject content into Prompt → LLM generates answer
                                              ↑
                              This is why RAG reduces hallucinations
```

### 7. AI Agent

```
Agent = LLM + Memory + Planning + Tools

Not simple Q&A, but rather:
Understand task → Make plan → Call tools → Observe results → Revise plan → Complete task
```

### 8. Fine-tuning

```
Fine-tuning = Continuing to train on specific data on top of a pre-trained model

Base Model (general capability) + Fine-tuning Data (domain knowledge) = Domain Expert Model

Key insight: Fine-tuning changes "style and format," not "injecting new knowledge" (that's RAG's job)
```

### 9. Temperature, Top-P, Top-K

| Parameter | What it does | PM's Adjustment Knob |
|------|--------|------------|
| Temperature (0-2) | Controls randomness | Low = deterministic/conservative (legal); High = creative/diverse (marketing) |
| Top-P (0-1) | Adaptive candidate word pool | Narrow = precise; Wide = diverse |
| Top-K | Hard limit on candidate word count | K=1 greedy; K=40 balanced; K=100+ creative |

### 10. Hallucination

```
Hallucination = Model-generated content that appears plausible but is factually incorrect

Types:
- Factual Hallucination: fabricating non-existent data/events/people
- Faithfulness Hallucination: output inconsistent with input
- Logical Hallucination: correct reasoning process but wrong conclusion

Mitigation Priority: RAG > Prompt Constraints > Fine-tuning > Human Review > Guardrails
Can never be fully eliminated — only probability can be reduced and impact lowered
```

## AI Agent Four Design Patterns + Five Architecture Patterns

### Four Design Patterns (Andrew Ng)

| Design Pattern | Core Idea | Typical Scenarios | Implementation Complexity |
|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Reflection** | Agent self-reviews output quality, discovers errors and corrects them | Code generation + self-check, copy polishing | ★★ |
| **Tool Use** | Agent calls external tools (APIs/databases/calculators) to complete sub-tasks | Data analysis, information retrieval, automation | ★★★ |
| **Planning** | Agent decomposes complex tasks into sub-tasks, executes sequentially | Multi-step workflows, travel planning | ★★★★ |
| **Multi-Agent** | Multiple agents divide work and collaborate, each specializing in different domains | Complex system development, multi-role simulation | ★★★★★ |

### Five Architecture Patterns

| Architecture Pattern | Core Flow | Representative Frameworks | Applicable Scenarios |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **ReAct** | Reasoning + Acting alternating cycles | LangChain ReAct | General scenarios requiring reasoning + action |
| **Plan-Execute** | First plan all steps, then execute step by step | LangGraph, Plan-and-Solve | Multi-step deterministic tasks |
| **LLM Compiler** | Compile tasks into DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), execute in parallel | LLMCompiler | Parallelizable complex tasks |
| **BabyAGI** | Task queue + priority sorting + result integration | BabyAGI | Tasks requiring continuous learning and adjustment |
| **Smolagents** | Lightweight code-generation agent | HuggingFace Smolagents | Code generation and automation |

### Framework Selection Decision Tree

```
What is your scenario?
├── Requires strict multi-step workflows → LangGraph (fastest, stateful graph)
├── Requires multi-role conversational collaboration → AutoGen (conversational)
├── Requires role-playing + task division → CrewAI (role-playing)
├── Low-code / non-technical team → Dify (low-code platform)
└── Google ecosystem / GCP → Google ADK
```

---

## Multi-Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Three Collaboration Patterns

| Pattern | Structure | Strengths | Weaknesses | Applicable Scenarios |
|------|------|------|------|---------|
| **Hierarchical** | One master Agent assigns tasks to sub-Agents | Strong control, clear accountability | Master Agent bottleneck, single point of failure | Deterministic task decomposition |
| **Peer-to-Peer** | Agents communicate and negotiate as equals | Flexible, no single point of failure | High coordination cost, potential infinite loops | Open-ended problem discussion |
| **Market-based** | Agents bid on tasks, best performer executes | High efficiency, natural selection | Complex implementation, requires evaluation mechanism | Tasks with clear evaluation criteria |

### Multi-Agent System Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|------|------|
| **Specialization** | Each Agent has clear responsibility boundaries and capability scope |
| **Communication Protocol** | Standardize inter-Agent communication format (structured JSON / natural language) |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Establish voting / arbitration / escalation mechanisms |
| **Fault Tolerance** | A single Agent failure should not crash the entire system |

## Agentic RAG Architecture Design

### Five Generations of RAG Evolution

| Generation | Time | Characteristics | Representative |
|------|------|------|------|
| **1.0 Naive RAG** | 2020 | Retrieve → Combine → Generate | Basic RAG |
| **2.0 Advanced RAG** | 2023 | Hybrid retrieval + Re-ranking | LangChain RAG |
| **3.0 GraphRAG** | 2024 | Knowledge graph + community summary + hierarchical retrieval (modular & configurable) | Microsoft GraphRAG / LlamaIndex |
| **4.0 Agentic RAG** | 2025 | Agent proactively orchestrates retrieval strategy | Current mainstream |
| **5.0 Multimodal Agentic RAG** | 2026 | Multimodal + Agent + Knowledge Graph | Cutting-edge direction |

### Agentic RAG Core Architecture (ReAct Loop)

```
Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → ...
 (Think)   (Act)    (Observe)     (Think)

Example:
Thought: The user asks "What was the highest-selling product in Q3?"
Action: Query database [SELECT product, SUM(revenue) FROM sales WHERE quarter='Q3' GROUP BY product ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC LIMIT 1]
Observation: Product A, ¥52 million
Thought: Also need to compare Q3 vs Q2 growth
Action: Query Q2 data...
Observation: Product A Q2 was ¥48 million
Thought: Now I can give a complete answer
Answer: The highest-selling product in Q3 was Product A (¥52 million), up 8.3% quarter-over-quarter
```

### GraphRAG Knowledge Graph Integration

Microsoft GraphRAG combines knowledge graphs with RAG:
- Traditional RAG accuracy: ~60%
- GraphRAG accuracy: **94%**
- Core difference: GraphRAG understands relationships between entities, not just semantic matching

### RAGAS Evaluation Framework

| Metric | Meaning | What it Measures |
|------|------|---------|
| **Faithfulness** | Whether the answer is faithful to the retrieved context | Degree of hallucination |
| **Contextual Relevancy** | Whether retrieved content is relevant to the question | Retrieval quality |
| **Answer Relevancy** | Whether the answer directly addresses the question | Answer quality |
| **Contextual Recall** | Whether all necessary information was retrieved | Retrieval completeness |
| **Contextual Precision** | Proportion of relevant items among retrieved results | Retrieval precision |

## AI Product Anti-Patterns Encyclopedia (25 Common Mistakes)

### Strategy Category

| # | Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **"Just Stuff AI In First"** — AI for AI's sake | First ask whether AI truly solves the problem |
| 2 | **Competing with OpenAI at the Model Layer** | Build proprietary data and experience moats at the application layer |
| 3 | **Ignoring the Data Flywheel** | Design implicit feedback collection mechanisms from Day 1 |
| 4 | **Pursuing SOTA Instead of Good Enough** | Model routing: simple → small model, complex → large model |
| 5 | **"AI Will Optimize Itself"** | Establish a continuous loop of evaluation → analysis → optimization |

### Technical Category

| # | Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|--------|---------|
| 6 | **Defaulting Everything to Agent** | First evaluate with simple LLM calls, upgrade only if insufficient |
| 7 | **Ignoring Token Costs** | Monitor inference cost per interaction from Day 1 |
| 8 | **Context Window Abuse** | Curate context, don't pile everything in |
| 9 | **RAG Only Using Vector Retrieval** | BM25 + Vector + Reranker is the production baseline |
| 10 | **Evaluation Set Made Up by PM** | Build from real user query sampling |

### UX Category

| # | Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|--------|---------|
| 11 | **Black-box AI** — Not showing reasoning process | Show reasoning steps + cite sources |
| 12 | **No Exit Design** | Always keep a manual operation path |
| 13 | **Pretending 100% Certainty** | Display confidence levels when uncertain |
| 14 | **AI Frequently Interrupting Users** | Passive assistance, not proactive interruption |
| 15 | **Ignoring Loading Experience** | Streaming output + progress indicators + skeleton screens |

### Security Category

| # | Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|--------|---------|
| 16 | **"Launch First, Security Later"** | At minimum deploy basic input/output guardrails |
| 17 | **Not Telling Users It's AI** | Clearly label AI identity |
| 18 | **Releasing Without Red Team Testing** | At minimum internal red team testing before launch |
| 19 | **Ignoring Low-Resource Language Security** | Test jailbreak risks for all supported languages |
| 20 | **No Emergency Circuit Breaker** | One-click stop all AI features |

### Commercialization Category

| # | Anti-Pattern | Correct Approach |
|---|--------|---------|
| 21 | **Selling AI with Per-Seat Pricing** | Hybrid model (base fee + usage) |
| 22 | **Unlimited Free AI Usage** | Set strict usage caps on free tier |
| 23 | **Not Tracking User-Level Costs** | Must be clear on each user's input-output ratio |
| 24 | **Underestimating Price Wars** | Token prices drop 10x annually, moat is data and experience |
| 25 | **AI Gross Margin < 50%** | Maintain 60%+ AI gross margin |

## World-Class AI PM Framework Library

### Shreyas Doshi's Product Sense (AI Era Edition)

```
In the AI era, Product Sense is the only irreplaceable capability.

Three Pillars:
1. Cognitive Empathy — See through the human needs behind users' irrational behavior
   AI is "emotionally colorblind": understands data, but not human hearts
2. Aesthetics & Taste — Sharp intuition for whether an interaction feels "right"
   AI can generate ten thousand solutions, but can't tell you which one gives users a visceral resonance
3. Business Intuition — Instantly see through the value exchange model behind anything
   AI lacks the ability to make correct decisions in extreme business ambiguity
```

### Chip Huyen's AI Engineering Framework

```
1. Evaluation-Driven Development
   → Build the evaluation set first, then write the Prompt. Evaluation is a navigator, not a checkpoint.

2. RAG is the Default Choice, Not the Last Resort
   → Most B2B AI products start with RAG.

3. Start Simple, Progressively Complex
   Simple LLM → +RAG → +Tools → +Agent → +Multi-Agent
   Don't skip levels! Verify each level before upgrading.

4. Systems Thinking, Not Model Thinking
   Excellent AI Product = Model (30%) + Context Engineering (25%) + Evaluation (20%) + Safety (15%) + UX (10%)
```

### Marily Nika's AI PM Three Pillars (Google)```
"All PMs will become AI PMs"

1. Technical literacy is non-negotiable — you don't need to write code, but you must understand ML concepts
2. From "translator" to "builder" — use AI tools yourself to prototype, test, and iterate
3. Ethical AI literacy — bias detection, data privacy, content safety are fundamental skills for AI PMs
```

## Global AI Governance & Regulatory Landscape

### International AI Regulatory Comparison Matrix

| Region | Key Regulation | Risk Classification | Key Requirements | Enforcement Body | Penalties |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| **EU** | EU AI Act (2024) | 4 tiers: Unacceptable / High / Limited / Minimal | CE marking, conformity assessment, fundamental rights impact assessment | EU AI Office + National Authorities | Up to €35M or 7% global turnover |
| **US** | EO 14179 "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in AI" (2025-01) + NIST AI RMF 1.0 | Voluntary framework (4 functions: Govern, Map, Measure, Manage) | Federal shift from mandatory reporting (EO 14110, revoked) to deregulation + AI Action Plan; practical compliance surface now at state level (e.g., Colorado AI Act, Texas TRAIGA, California AI laws) | NIST + Sector-specific agencies + State AGs | Sector-specific + State enforcement |
| **UK** | AI Regulation White Paper (2023) + AI Safety Institute | Context-specific, principles-based (5 principles) | Cross-sectoral principles, no new regulator | Existing regulators (ICO, FCA, CMA, etc.) | Sector-specific |
| **China** | Generative AI Administrative Measures (2023) + Algorithm Filing | Content-based classification | Algorithm filing, security assessment, content moderation, training data compliance | Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) | Service suspension, fines, criminal liability |
| **Japan** | AI Guidelines for Business (2024) | Non-binding, sector-specific | Voluntary AI governance framework, human-centric principles | METI + MIC | Sector-specific |
| **Singapore** | PDPC AI Governance Framework + AI Verify | Voluntary, risk-based | AI Verify testing toolkit, model governance framework | PDPC + IMDA | PDPA enforcement |
| **Canada** | AIDA (Bill C-27, proposed) | High-impact systems | Risk assessment, transparency, human oversight | Proposed AI & Data Commissioner | Up to CAD $25M or 5% revenue |
| **South Korea** | AI Basic Law (proposed 2024) | High-risk AI systems | Safety certification, human oversight, transparency | MSIT + KISA | Up to KRW 300M or 3% revenue |
| **UAE** | UAE AI Strategy 2031 + AI Ethics Guidelines | Sector-specific | AI ethics principles, sector-specific guidelines | UAE AI Office | Sector-specific |

> ⚠️ **Corrected 2026-07 (current version prevails)**: The original table entry "AI Executive Order 14110 (2023)" was factually incorrect — **EO 14110 was revoked by EO 14179 on Jan 23, 2025**. EO 14179 shifts to a deregulatory stance and directs development of an "AI Action Plan" (released in 2025). Consequently, there is no unified federal mandatory framework akin to the EU AI Act; practical compliance responsibility shifts down to **state-level legislation**:
> - **Colorado AI Act** (SB 24-205, signed May 2024, effective Feb 2026) — the first U.S. state law targeting "high-risk AI systems";
> - **Texas Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA)** (effective 2025);
> - **California**: multiple AI bills advanced in the 2024–2025 legislative cycle (including successors to the vetoed SB 1047).
> Practitioners should follow the latest legislation of the **state where the product is sold / service is provided**.
>
> > **Corrected 2026-07: EO 14110 was revoked by EO 14179 on Jan 23, 2025.** EO 14179 shifted to a deregulation stance and directed the formulation of an "AI Action Plan" (to be issued within 2025). As a result, there is no longer a unified mandatory federal framework comparable to the EU AI Act; practical compliance has shifted to **state-level legislation**:
> > - **Colorado AI Act** (SB 24-205, signed May 2024, effective Feb 2026) — the first state-level act targeting "high-risk AI systems" in the US;
> > - **Texas Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA)** (effective 2025);
> > - **California**: multiple AI bills advanced through the 2024–2025 legislative cycle (including successor variants to the vetoed SB 1047).
> > Practitioners should refer to the latest legislation in the **state where the product is sold or served**.

### NIST AI RMF 1.0 — Four Functions Deep Dive

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) provides a structured approach to AI risk management:

| Function | Core Activities | AI PM's Role |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **GOVERN** | Establish AI risk culture, policies, accountability | Define AI governance structure, risk appetite, escalation paths |
| **MAP** | Understand AI system context, identify risks | Map AI system components, data flows, stakeholders, potential harms |
| **MEASURE** | Assess AI risks using quantitative/qualitative methods | Design evaluation metrics, monitor trustworthiness characteristics |
| **MANAGE** | Prioritize and respond to AI risks | Implement guardrails, document risk decisions, continuous monitoring |

### California SB 1047 — Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier AI Models

> ⚠️ **Corrected 2026-07 (current version prevails)**: SB 1047 was **vetoed by the California Governor in Sep 2024 and never became law**. The points below are its original proposal highlights, provided only as conceptual reference for "frontier model safety," and should not be treated as current compliance requirements.

Key provisions relevant to AI PMs (as originally proposed):
- **Safety testing**: Mandatory safety testing for models above compute threshold (10^26 FLOPS)
- **Kill switch**: Full shutdown capability required
- **Third-party auditing**: Annual third-party safety audits
- **Liability**: Developer liability for catastrophic harms
- **Whistleblower protection**: Employee protection for reporting safety concerns

### UK AI Safety Institute (AISI)

The UK's approach focuses on frontier AI safety evaluation:
- **Pre-deployment testing**: Voluntary but strongly encouraged for frontier models
- **Evaluation domains**: Cybersecurity, bio/chemical capabilities, autonomous systems, societal impacts
- **International collaboration**: Bletchley Declaration, Seoul Summit, AI Safety Summits
- **PM implications**: Prepare for pre-deployment evaluation requirements, document safety testing results

## Final Reminders

> **The Ultimate AI PM Mindset (12 Iron Rules):**
>
> 1. **AI is a tool, not magic** — Start from narrow scenarios, build moats with data
> 2. **Models will commoditize, data and experience won't** — The moat is proprietary data and unique experience

## Appendix A: Embedding Model Selection Deep Dive

> Embeddings are the cornerstone of RAG. Choose the wrong embedding model, and even the best retrieval strategy is wasted.

### Mainstream Embedding Model Comparison

| Model | Dimensions | Max Input | MTEB Chinese | Cost/1M tokens | Best Scenario |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| text-embedding-3-large (OpenAI) | 3072/256/1024 | 8191 | Medium | $0.13 | English, multilingual |

```
1. Primary language?
   ├── Mainly Chinese → bge-large-zh-v1.5 or stella-base-zh
   ├── Mainly English → text-embedding-3-large
   ├── Mixed multilingual → bge-m3 or multilingual-e5-large
   └── Need on-premise deployment → bge series (open-source)

2. Document length?
   ├── Short (<512 tokens) → bge-large-zh-v1.5
   ├── Long (512-8192) → bge-m3 or jina-embeddings-v3
   └── Extra-long (>8192) → Chunk first, then embed

3. Dimension preference?
   ├── Accuracy-first (>1024 dims) → text-embedding-3-large (3072) or stella (1792)
   ├── Speed-first (768 dims) → bge-base-zh-v1.5
   └── Storage-first (<512 dims) → text-embedding-3-small (512)
```

### Embedding Quality Checklist

```
□ Synonym recall test: Can "contract expiration" retrieve "agreement termination"?
□ Polysemy distinction test: Is "apple" correctly distinguished in tech vs. fruit contexts?
□ Negation semantic test: Do retrieval results for "does not include XX" contain XX?
□ Cross-language test: Can Chinese queries retrieve English documents? (if needed)
□ Long document test: Does embedding quality degrade for 512+ token documents?
□ Domain terminology test: How effective is retrieval for industry-specific terms?
```

### Selection Decision

```
Vector count < 100K + rapid prototyping → Chroma (zero ops)
Vector count 100K-1M + already have PG → pgvector (zero additional cost)
Vector count 1M-100M + small/medium team → Qdrant or Weaviate
Vector count > 100M + enterprise-grade → Milvus (distributed scaling)
Don't want to self-manage + sufficient budget → Pinecone
Already have ES + need hybrid search → ElasticSearch
```

### Key Production Considerations

## Appendix C: RAG Chunking Strategy Deep Dive

### Chunking Method Comparison

| Chunking Method | Principle | Pros | Cons | Best Scenario |
|---------|------|------|------|---------|
| **Fixed Size** | Split by token count (e.g., 512 tokens) | Simple, controllable, predictable | Cuts off semantics | Initial solution, uniform documents |
| **By Paragraph** | Split by natural paragraphs | Semantically complete | Uneven length | Well-structured documents |
| **By Heading Hierarchy** | Split by H1/H2/H3 levels | Preserves context hierarchy | Complex implementation | Technical docs/help docs |
| **Semantic Chunking** | Use LLM to determine optimal split points | Semantically optimal | High cost, slow | High-quality requirement scenarios |
| **Hybrid Chunking** | Paragraph + fixed size fallback | Balances semantics and control | Complex rules | Recommended for production |
| **Sentence Window** | Split by sentences + window context | Fine-grained retrieval | Large storage | Scenarios needing precise positioning |

### Chunk Size Selection Guide

```
Chunk size 256 tokens:
  → Pros: Precise retrieval, low latency
  → Cons: Incomplete context, easy semantic cutoff
  → Suitable for: FAQ, short answers

Chunk size 512 tokens:
  → Pros: Balanced precision and completeness ← Recommended starting point
  → Suitable for: Most RAG scenarios

Chunk size 1024 tokens:
  → Pros: More complete context
  → Cons: Retrieval may bring back irrelevant content
  → Suitable for: Complex documents, technical manuals

Chunk size 2048+ tokens:
  → Pros: Long paragraphs not cut off
  → Cons: Low signal-to-noise ratio
  → Suitable for: Legal documents, academic papers
```

### Chunking Optimization in Practice

```
Chunking optimization loop:
1. Run retrieval with current chunking strategy
2. Collect Bad Cases (retrieved irrelevant / failed to retrieve relevant)
3. Analyze root causes:
   - Semantics cut off → Increase chunk size or add overlap
   - Too much noise → Reduce chunk size or add Reranker
   - Heading info lost → Prepend document title to each chunk
4. Adjust strategy → Re-evaluate → Compare RAGAS metrics
5. Repeat until satisfied

Key techniques:
- Add metadata prefix to each chunk: [Document Title] | [Section] | [Update Date]
- Small Chunk + Large Context Window: Retrieve with small chunks + bring back adjacent chunks
- Hierarchical Indexing: First retrieve document → then retrieve specific passages within that document
```

## Appendix D: Agent Tool Design Patterns & Practices

### 5 Principles of Tool Design

```
1. Single Responsibility: One tool does one thing
   ❌ "query_database" — too vague
   ✅ "query_order_info" / "query_member_points" — specific

2. Self-Describing: Tool name + description lets LLM understand at a glance
   ✅ Tool name: cancel_order
   ✅ Description: Cancel a specified order, requires order number and cancellation reason, returns cancellation status

3. Verifiable Output: Return structured results so LLM can determine success
   ✅ {status: "success", data: {...}, error: null}
   ❌ "The order seems to have been cancelled" (LLM has to guess)

4. Idempotency: Same input, multiple calls produce the same result (especially for mutation tools)
   ✅ Create order: use idempotency_key to prevent duplicates
   ✅ Cancel order: already-cancelled orders return "already cancelled" rather than error

5. Error-Friendly: Error messages must have enough context for LLM to decide next steps
   ✅ {error: "Order ORD123 not found, possibly wrong order number or order doesn't belong to current user"}
   ❌ {error: "not found"}
```

### Tool Count Management

| Agent Type | Recommended Tool Count | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Simple Agent | 3-5 | Reduce confusion |
| Standard Agent | 5-10 | Cover core capabilities |
| Complex Agent | 10-20 | Multi-domain |
| Super Agent | 20-50 | Requires tool grouping + dynamic loading |

**What if there are too many tools?**
- Tool grouping: Group by domain (order-related, member-related, knowledge base-related)
- Dynamic loading: Agent first determines intent → only loads relevant tool groups
- Tool naming convention: `domain_action_object` (e.g., `order_query_status`)

### Common Tool Calling Issues

| Issue | Manifestation | Solution |
|------|------|------|
| Hallucinated calls | Calls non-existent tools | Add "only use provided tools" in tool description |
| Parameter hallucination | Fabricates parameter values | Require Agent to extract parameters from user input / prior results |
| Loop calls | Repeatedly calls the same tool | Set max retry count (3 times) |
| Premature abandonment | Gives up after one failure | Include retry suggestions in tool response |
| Permission errors | Calls tools without permission | Include permission requirements in tool definition |

### Effective PM-ML Engineer Collaboration

```
What PMs should NOT do:
❌ "This model isn't good enough, can you make it more accurate?" (too vague)
❌ "I read a paper saying XX model has the highest SOTA, let's use that" (benchmark-only thinking)
❌ "Why can't it answer this? You're an AI!" (not understanding capability boundaries)

What PMs SHOULD do:
✅ "In this 50-item test set, the model's accuracy on refund policy questions is 70%,
   the main failure modes are... I suggest optimizing from XX direction" (specific + data + suggestions)
✅ "For this scenario our latency budget is only 500ms,
   which of these three models can meet that? What accuracy can we achieve?" (constraints + trade-offs)
✅ "User feedback says AI responses are too verbose, here are 5 Bad Cases,
   can we adjust the Prompt or do we need fine-tuning?" (problem + evidence + options)
```

□ Output token limits (max_tokens) — save 5-15%
□ Identical query result caching — save 20-40%
□ Common FAQ pre-generation + caching — save 30-50%

Phase 3: Architecture Optimization (Months 2-3)
□ Model routing (simple → small model) — save 40-60%
□ Semantic caching (similar query reuse) — save 20-40%
□ Batch processing (non-real-time scenarios) — save 20-50%

Phase 4: Deep Optimization (Months 4-6)

```
Alert trigger conditions:
□ Single user daily cost > 200% of yesterday
□ Single user daily cost > overall P99
□ Free user daily cost > $1
□ Large model share in model routing > 40% (check if routing is broken)
□ Cache hit rate < 30% (check if cache is broken)
□ AI gross margin < 50% (check cost structure)
```

## Appendix H: AI PM Daily Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Prompt Debugging

```
PM daily workflow:
1. Discover Bad Case (user complaint / evaluation failure / self-discovery)
2. Analyze: Is it a prompt problem? Retrieval problem? Model capability problem?
3. If it's a prompt problem → pinpoint which specific sentence is problematic
4. Modify prompt → test on the Bad Case
5. Regression test on the full Golden Dataset
6. Evaluation comparison report → pass → gradual rollout

Debugging tips:
- Add Few-Shot first (fastest results)
- Then modify constraint statements ("You must..." / "You must not...")
- Finally modify role description (least impact)
- Change only one thing at a time, A/B compare
```

### Scenario 2: Model Upgrade Evaluation

```
When upstream models upgrade (e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5→4):
1. Run old vs. new model comparison on existing Golden Dataset
2. Focus on:
   - Which scenarios improved? (don't need attention)
   - Which scenarios regressed? (need focused attention!)
   - Cost changes (new models are usually more expensive)
   - Latency changes
3. Deep analysis of regression scenarios → may need prompt adjustments
4. Cost-benefit analysis → decide whether to migrate
5. If migrating: 5%→25%→100% gradual rollout
```

### Scenario 3: User Says "AI Isn't Smart Enough"

```
User's "not smart enough" could mean:
├── Didn't understand their intent → Query rewriting / clarification mechanism
├── Response too generic → Retrieval not precise enough / missing user profile
├── Response incorrect → Knowledge base outdated / hallucination / insufficient model capability
├── Wrong format → Prompt output format constraints insufficient
├── Response too slow → Model too large / no streaming output
├── Missing citations → RAG didn't return sources
├── Unnatural tone → Prompt role description needs adjustment
└── Didn't remember context → Conversation history management issue

PM's diagnostic process:
1. Look at actual conversation logs (don't just rely on user reports)
2. Reproduce the issue yourself
3. Pinpoint the specific link in the chain
4. Apply targeted remedy, not generic "optimize AI"
```

### Impact of Technology Trends on Product Strategy

```
Trend 1: Accelerating model commoditization
→ The moat is not in model choice, but in data flywheel and user experience
→ Design model-switchable architecture (don't lock into one vendor)

Trend 2: Rapidly declining inference costs
→ AI can unlock more and more scenarios
→ But also means competitors can quickly replicate your AI features
→ Differentiation lies in proprietary data and deep integration

Trend 3: Agents moving from demo to production
→ 2025-2026 is the critical year for Agents from experimentation to production
→ Agent reliability, safety, and cost remain major challenges
→ PMs need to think: Do users really need an Agent? Or just a better UI?

Trend 4: AI shifting from "assisting" to "doing"
→ AI from assistive tool → autonomously completing work
→ Sequoia: Service-as-a-Software
→ PM's reflection: Does your product help users do, or do it for users?

```

### Build vs Buy vs Fine-Tune Decision Matrix

```
Is this a differentiating capability?
├── Yes → BUILD (proprietary model)
│         Requirements: sufficient data + budget + ML team
│         Cost: 7B ≈ $100K, 70B ≈ $1-5M
│         Timeline: 6-18 months
│
└── No → Is there proprietary data the model needs to learn?
          ├── Yes → FINE-TUNE (API or open-source model)
          │         Cost: $15 (LoRA small model) – $50K+
          │         Timeline: 1-4 weeks
          │         Best for: style/format/domain terminology
          │
          └── No → BUY (direct API use)
                    Cost: pay-per-use
                    Timeline: instant
                    Best for: most scenarios

Industry consensus: "Buy the substrates. Build the autonomy."
→ Purchase base models, build differentiation layers on top
```

### Key Selection Considerations

|--------|------|------|------|
| Data sovereignty | Cloud API / Private deploy / On-device | Private deploy for regulated industries | Data localization compliance |
| Latency requirement | <500ms / 1-3s / Async | Match model size to latency budget | Streaming + small model for real-time |
| Call volume | <1K/day / 1K-100K/day / >100K/day | API → Semantic cache → Self-hosted | Breakeven at ~100K calls/day |
| Task reuse | Repeated pattern / Diverse | Repeated → Fine-tune small model | Cost reduction 10-100x |
| Multilingual | English only / Multi-language / Chinese | Multi-language → BGE-M3 + Mistral/Llama | Chinese → Qwen/DeepSeek/BGE |
