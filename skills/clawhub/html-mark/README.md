# HTML Mark

> **Click-to-annotate overlay for any HTML page.** Drop coral-gradient pins on any element, write feedback inline, copy out as Markdown / Plain / JSON — or as a **For AI** handoff that pastes straight into Claude Code for one-pass fixes.

### ▶︎ [**Try it live — no install**](https://xuxinmaxen.github.io/html-mark/)

A fake product page you can annotate right now: press `M`, click anything, write a note, copy it out as Markdown. 30 seconds, nothing to set up.

## New in 1.2

- **For AI export** — a fourth format with a unique CSS selector + HTML snapshot per pin, written to be pasted straight into Claude Code (or any coding agent): *"Copy all → paste → every note gets fixed in one pass."*
- **Pins anchor to their element** — they survive window resizes and responsive reflows instead of drifting off-target.
- **Annotations persist** — stored in `localStorage` per page and restored on reload, so an accidental refresh no longer loses a review.
- **Hover preview** — while marking, the element a click *would* annotate shows a dashed outline before you commit.
- **Undo for Clear** — clearing all pins shows a 5-second Undo toast instead of being irreversible.

## See it in action

**Activate** — a dark glass pill in the top-right corner. Click it or press `M`, then click anywhere on the page to start dropping pins.

**Annotate** — every click drops a coral-gradient pin and opens an inline note popup. Press `Enter` to save, the pin gets a small coral dot indicating "has note." Notes accumulate in the side panel — click "Copy all" to grab them as Markdown.

The output you'd paste into Notion / Linear / Lark:

```markdown
**1.** change the color to red
   <sub>#header_logo · `#header_logo`</sub>

**2.** add more picture
   <sub>[data-mm-label] · `[data-mm-label]`</sub>
```

## Why this exists

Design review is usually one of two things:

1. **Screenshots with red circles in Figma** — slow, fragmented, hard to ship.
2. **"On the third card from the left, the price font is too small…"** — verbose, lossy, easy to miss.

HTML Mark collapses both into a single workflow:

> **Click → write what's wrong → press Enter → copy → paste.**

The output is structured Markdown ready for any review tool. The reviewer's hands never leave the keyboard.

## Install

### Via ClawHub (recommended)

```bash
clawhub install html-mark
```

The skill auto-loads in Claude Code. Then in any chat:

```
Add html-mark to /path/to/prototype.html
```

Claude injects the runtime as a `<script>` block before `</body>`, keeping the HTML self-contained so you can email or AirDrop it.

### Manual

```bash
# Option A: inline (best for single-file prototypes)
cat ~/.claude/skills/html-mark/html-mark.js
# paste inside <script>…</script> right before </body>

# Option B: external script (best for multi-page projects)
<script src="./html-mark.js"></script>
```

### Bookmarklet (any URL, no source access needed)

Generate a self-contained bookmarklet that works on any page:

```bash
echo "javascript:$(python3 -c "
import urllib.parse
js = open('$HOME/.claude/skills/html-mark/html-mark.js').read()
print(urllib.parse.quote(js, safe=''))
")"
```

Save as a browser bookmark. Click it on any page to enter mark mode. See [`examples/advanced.md`](examples/advanced.md) for the hosted variant and CSP caveats.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `M` | Toggle mark mode |
| `Esc` | Exit mark mode / close note popup |
| `Backspace` | Delete last pin (when not typing) |
| `Enter` | Save note |
| `Shift+Enter` | New line in note |

---

## Visual style

| Element | Look |
|---|---|
| **Toggle** | Dark glass pill, top-right. ON state: glowing coral-gradient dot + honey text. |
| **Pin** | 22px coral-gradient orb (`#ff8d6b → #ffaf7a → #ffc890`), white border, soft coral glow. A coral dot appears on the top-right corner once it has a note. |
| **Note popup** | Real glassmorphism (`backdrop-filter: blur(24px) saturate(160%)`), gradient highlight line on top, appears next to its pin. |
| **Panel** | Glass card, draggable header, collapsible to a single-row badge. List items with a note show a vertical coral accent bar on the left. |
| **Toast** | Dark glass capsule, bottom center, fades after 2s. |

All UI uses `.mm-*` class prefixes — guaranteed not to collide with your target page's CSS.

---

## Custom labels

Pin labels are auto-inferred from `id` / `aria-label` / button text / heading level. For semantically opaque elements (a generic `<div>` representing a card, say), set:

```html
<div class="card" data-mm-label="Plan card: Mini">…</div>
```

The pin's label will use `data-mm-label` verbatim, making the copied output much easier to read.

---

## Export formats

Pick the format that fits your downstream tool from the panel footer dropdown:

| Format | Best for |
|---|---|
| **Markdown** (default) | Notion, Linear, GitHub issues, Lark docs |
| **Plain** | Slack / chat, quick text dumps |
| **JSON** | Programmatic processing, developer handoff |

## Why glassmorphism?

The skill gets invoked across many target pages — light, dark, neutral, brand-heavy. A neutral chrome would either disappear on busy pages or feel out of place on premium designs. Glass with a warm coral accent:

- Stays legible on any background (blur + saturate carries enough contrast)
- Feels native to high-end product UIs (Vision Pro / Stripe / Linear visual vocabulary)
- Coral palette is warm but professional — won't clash with brand colors

Want a different accent? Fork and swap the `linear-gradient(135deg, #ff8d6b 0%, #ffaf7a 55%, #ffc890 100%)` value across the CSS — it's the only color token used for accents.

## Versions

- **1.1.1** (2026-05-19) — Embed demo screenshots in SKILL.md (the page ClawHub renders) using absolute GitHub raw URLs, so images are visible on both GitHub and ClawHub. Swap screenshot filenames to match content.
- **1.1.0** (2026-05-19) — Add demo screenshots, all docs translated to English. No runtime changes.
- **1.0.0** (2026-05-19) — Initial release: glass UI, coral pins, inline note popups, draggable panel, Markdown/Plain/JSON export, keyboard shortcuts. (Originally published under the `mark-mode` slug; renamed to `html-mark` to make scope clearer.)
