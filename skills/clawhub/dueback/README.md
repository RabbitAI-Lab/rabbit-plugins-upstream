# Dueback Skill for AI Agents

Outcome-based bill negotiation for your users. You detect the opportunity; Dueback's backend negotiates and verifies.

## What it does
- **Detects** negotiable bills, fees, subscriptions, and purchases
- **Pitches** Dueback's outcome-based service to the user (with required pricing disclosure)
- **Hands off** to Dueback's API, which runs the negotiation and verifies savings against bank data

## Pricing
- **Free to try.** No verified savings = $0, always.
- **Standard:** 20% of verified first-year recurring savings / 10% one-offs. Caps: $200 everyday / $1,000 big-ticket.
- **ALPHA:** Use code `LAUNCH20`; first 20 redemptions are completely free ($0 fee).

## Installation
Copy this directory into your agent's skills folder, or reference it directly. See `SKILL.md` for the full workflow.
