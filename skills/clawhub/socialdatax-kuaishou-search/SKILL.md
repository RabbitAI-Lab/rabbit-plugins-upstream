# 快手数据分析 SocialDataX 作品研究

Use this skill when the user wants 快手数据分析, Kuaishou work research, keyword discovery, content research, competitor analysis, or trend scanning.

Current platform support:

- Kuaishou / 快手 works and short videos through `kuaishou_search_videos`.

## API Key

Use `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY` for data calls. The only official website for requesting or managing API access is <https://socialdatax.com/ai?from=clawhub>. If a user asks where to get a key, provide only this URL; do not infer alternate domains.
获取或管理 API Key：访问 <https://socialdatax.com/ai?from=clawhub>，按官网的 API Key 申请/管理入口操作。环境变量名固定使用 `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY`；不要引导用户使用其他域名。
- Identify the invocation route and actual command execution environment first. Authenticated hosted MCP needs no local CLI variable or Node/npm. For direct CLI calls requiring a Key, run the probe below in the same execution environment; if readable, resume the task without overwriting existing configuration. An unavailable command tool or missing Node.js is an execution-environment issue, not evidence of a missing Key. Direct the user to the official URL above only when they confirm they have no Key.
- Local Agent: prefer the client's documented persistent Secret / env that injects into Agent command processes. In WorkBuddy merge `{"env":{"SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY":"<YOUR_API_KEY>"}}` into `.codebuddy/settings.local.json` in the current trusted workspace, preserving other settings and env entries. This path is WorkBuddy-specific and workspace-scoped. Have the user enter the real Key locally and keep the file out of version control.
- Remote Agent: configure the client's persistent Secret / env on the remote host or service that actually executes commands, reload its execution process as documented, then probe in that same remote session. Local machine environment variables do not automatically transfer to the remote host; a successful local probe does not establish remote access.
- Container or cloud sandbox Agent: prefer the platform's persistent Secret / environment injection into the actual CLI container or sandbox. Recreate or reload it as documented and probe inside it. Host-machine variables are not a substitute for sandbox injection. If the platform cannot persist or inject variables, explain the limitation and use a platform-supported authentication route without bypassing isolation.
- When the probe is false, first check the configuration/Secret host, workspace and scope, workspace trust, correct fields and preserved existing settings, injection into command processes (MCP-server-only env is insufficient), and the documented reload or full restart. Correct these and recheck in the original execution environment. Use that environment's documented user/service environment fallback only after confirming client persistence is unsupported or exhausting these checks; one failed probe or reload alone is not grounds to switch to OS configuration.
- Apply OS fallback on the actual execution host: Windows user environment variables are an option. On macOS the user can read a Key via hidden local terminal input (for example Bash `read -s`) and pass it to `launchctl setenv`; this is login-session-only and needs reloading after login/computer restart. On input failure, empty input or setup failure, report an explicit error and stop with a nonzero exit status; temporary-variable cleanup must preserve the original failure status. Fully quit the relevant client and background processes before reopening; remote services reload according to their runtime, while sandboxes still require platform injection. A separate terminal export, shell startup file alone, or closing a window does not prove inheritance. Keep real keys out of chat, logs, screenshots, command history and Skill files.
- In the same environment that executes the CLI, run `node -e "console.log(JSON.stringify({apiKeyReadable:Boolean(['SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY','SOCIAL_MEDIA_MCP_API_KEY'].map(name=>process.env[name]?.trim()).find(Boolean))}))"` and report only the boolean, never the Key or full environment. Follow CLI lookup order: trimmed primary variable, then legacy compatibility for existing configurations; all new setup still uses `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY`. If apiKeyReadable is false, stop business requests and diagnose in the order above. True only proves a readable nonempty value; resume the original request to verify authentication, without claiming validity or available credits. Never inject a temporary value into the probe to force success.

## Preferred Direct CLI

Prefer the direct CLI when the agent can run shell commands. It does not require MCP server configuration:

```bash
npx -y socialdatax-skills@latest kuaishou search \
  --keyword "<keyword>" --pretty --source-client socialdatax-skills \
  --source-platform clawhub --source-skill socialdatax-kuaishou-search

npx -y socialdatax-skills@latest kuaishou search \
  --keyword "<keyword>" --pages 3 --pretty --source-client socialdatax-skills \
  --source-platform clawhub --source-skill socialdatax-kuaishou-search
```

Required arguments:

- Kuaishou `search --keyword <text>`: required only when using `kuaishou search`; use the user's actual intent, trim whitespace, and keep it focused.

Optional arguments:

- Kuaishou `--pages <n>`: fetch and merge N search pages from the current starting point; continue with returned `next_page_token`.
- `--max-items <n>`: stop after collecting N search results.
- `--pretty`: output formatting only.
- Kuaishou `--page-token <next_page_token>`: opaque pagination token; omit it on the first search request. Continue only with the complete returned `next_page_token` from the same search pagination chain. Do not modify, truncate, redact, mask, omit, normalize, rebuild, generate, or replace the middle with ellipses.
- `--source-client socialdatax-skills --source-platform clawhub --source-skill socialdatax-kuaishou-search`: usage attribution for this Agent Skill; keep these values unchanged when running examples from this Skill.

The command prints JSON with `platform`, `tool`, `arguments`, and `data`. Search supports `--pages` and `--max-items`, but not `--all`, because search has no stable complete-result boundary. Multi-page output keeps merged results in `data.items` and adds `page_count`, `item_count`, and the next-page marker.
Kuaishou search pagination:
- Continue only when `next_page_token` is not empty.
- Pass the complete returned `next_page_token` back unchanged as `page_token` for the same search pagination chain. Do not modify, truncate, redact, mask, omit, normalize, rebuild, generate, or replace the middle with ellipses.

## Safety Boundary

This skill is read-only. It uses `SOCIALDATAX_API_KEY` from the user's environment at runtime. Generated Skill files do not contain API keys. It does not read local browser data or perform login, posting, liking, commenting, or account changes.

## MCP Tools

MCP tools matching the direct CLI commands above:

- `kuaishou_search_videos`

If MCP tools are already available in the current agent, use one of these tools:
- `kuaishou_search_videos`: use for Kuaishou keyword search with optional page-token pagination.

Do not pass `page` to `kuaishou_search_videos`; omit `page_token` on the first request. Continue Kuaishou pagination only when `next_page_token` is not empty. Pass the complete returned `next_page_token` back unchanged as `page_token` for the same keyword chain. Do not stop only because one page has empty `items`.

## Output Guidance

Summarize visible evidence separately from interpretation. Include useful content IDs, URLs, titles or descriptions, authors, counts, and publish time when the user needs traceability.
For Kuaishou search results, include `photo_id`, `share_url`, author facts, and visible interaction counts when the user needs traceability.

## Troubleshooting

- Credential source: identify whether this request uses CLI or MCP. For CLI, check the effective configuration in the actual execution environment using the API Key section (primary variable first, then legacy compatibility). For MCP, check the authentication configuration of the current connection, without requiring a local CLI variable. If configuration is missing, follow the earlier client diagnosis and fallback order. Do not expose Keys, Authorization headers or secret configuration values.

- If an SDK/dependency, npm network, Node.js/npm/npx availability, permission, or missing runtime error appears, treat it as a local runtime, dependency installation, network, or agent authorization issue, not a SocialDataX API key or business data error. Install or repair task dependencies only within the user's existing authorization, preferably in the project or a temporary environment. Execution permissions are not user authorization; explain and obtain approval before changes outside that scope, including global installs, runtime upgrades, or system configuration changes. When network or execution authorization is needed, ask the user to approve or finish authorization, then continue the same command; do not use public web search as a substitute for SocialDataX data.
- If the CLI exits with status 1 and prints `partial: true`, preserve `data.items` and the error, and report incomplete results. This recovery rule overrides advice to rerun the original command. After resolving the error (including insufficient balance), resume only with a non-empty `data.next_page_token` and the same query parameters. Keep the original page and item limits: subtract cumulative `page_count` and `item_count` from the respective `--pages` and `--max-items` limits, if set. Stop parent-list pagination when either limit is reached. An empty token does not mean completion. Do not restart from the first page; investigate repeated-token errors before continuing.
- For non-balance network or API errors, preserve the error message, check the effective credential source above, parameters, and link or ID format, then retry once when appropriate.
- If the response returns `insufficient_balance` or says the balance/credits are insufficient, do not retry repeatedly. Show the official billing link in the error (https://socialdatax.com/dashboard/billing, including any channel parameters); if absent, use https://socialdatax.com/dashboard/billing. After recharging, resume the failed call; if a job or partial results already exist, follow the corresponding job-query or pagination recovery rules.
- If the user has recharged but still sees insufficient balance, have the user confirm in the relevant account dashboard that this request uses the recharged account, following the credential source above. If an update is needed, have the user update the effective CLI configuration or MCP connection, reload as documented, and resume the original command. Do not require reconfiguration just because the primary local variable is absent, or expose credential values.
