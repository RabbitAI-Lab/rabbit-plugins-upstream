This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

## Publisher:

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Creators and developers use this skill to align a person's mouth movements in an existing video with replacement speech, optionally selecting a face in a multi-person video.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Selected video, audio, and optional face images are uploaded to dLazy cloud services.

Mitigation: Only submit media approved for external processing and review the service terms before use.

Risk: The CLI requires a dLazy API key for generation.

Mitigation: Keep the key private and rotate or revoke it if exposed.

Risk: The documented example and sample output conflict with the video and audio input options.

Mitigation: Check `dlazy videoretalk -h` and use `--video_url` and `--audio_url` rather than the stale `--prompt` example.
