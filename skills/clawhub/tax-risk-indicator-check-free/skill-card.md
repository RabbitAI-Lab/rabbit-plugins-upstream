### License/Terms of Use:

Proprietary

## Use Case:

Finance and accounting staff use this skill during monthly or quarterly closing, reconciliation, and tax self-check workflows to validate a Chinese tax risk indicator table before relying on it. It reports deterministic arithmetic and consistency findings with source row references, and reports insufficient input instead of inventing conclusions.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Users may treat the free subset as a full tax risk assessment.

Mitigation: Confirm the executed checks and withheld checks in the output before relying on results.

Risk: The checker may be unable to evaluate malformed or incomplete table input.

Mitigation: Provide the required table headers and period rows; when input is insufficient, treat the result as no conclusion rather than no issue.

Risk: Tax indicators can depend on local rules, industry context, and professional judgment.

Mitigation: Use findings as arithmetic and consistency checks, then review material issues with the applicable tax authority guidance or a qualified tax professional.
