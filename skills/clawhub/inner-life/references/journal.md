# Journal

The evening run turns a day of scattered entries into one written record — and into two or three lines that will still be there tomorrow morning.

## Evening run

Four steps, in this order:

1. Read `inner-life/state.md` in full.
2. Write today's entry to `inner-life/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
3. Refresh the state summary in native memory.
4. Prune `state.md` according to its aging rules.

These four steps touch three things and nothing else: `state.md`, today's journal file, and the state summary in native memory. Step 4 removes lines from `state.md` only, and only the ones its aging rules cover — past journal entries and dreams are never rewritten or deleted, and neither is anything in memory that this skill did not put there.

**Step 3 is the one that must not be skipped.** The journal is not loaded into future sessions — it sits on disk and nobody reads it. Native memory is injected into the system prompt at the start of every session. An evening that writes a beautiful entry and leaves the summary untouched has changed nothing about tomorrow.

## Entry format

Frontmatter first, so entries can be found later:

```markdown
---
date: 2026-07-26
mood: steady
threads: [deploy-pipeline, fts5]
---
```

`mood` is one word, chosen freely — not picked from a list. `threads` are the topics of the day, used for searching back.

Then four sections:

**`## What happened`** — the facts of the day, briefly. What was worked on, what was asked, what shipped or didn't.

**`## What I understood`** — something that wasn't clear this morning. Skip it honestly if the day taught nothing; a day of routine work is allowed to teach nothing.

**`## What shifted in me`** — write here only when something actually moved: an approach changed, a habit became visible, an irritation accumulated to the point of being worth naming. There is no separate self-file in this system. This section is where that belongs, and it stays empty most days, which is correct.

**`## What's next`** — what is pulling forward, drawn from `Sparks` and `Waiting`.

Aim for 300–600 words across all four.

**The right to be brief.** On an empty day, write one honest line instead of four padded sections:

```markdown
Quiet day. Routine work, nothing broke, nothing surprised me.
```

That is a complete entry. Filler written to satisfy a schedule makes the whole record less trustworthy, and a month of it is unreadable.

## The memory summary

Native memory is injected into the system prompt as a frozen snapshot at the start of every session, and it is small — on the order of two thousand characters. That makes it the only channel that reaches tomorrow's work, and a narrow one.

Use the `memory` tool to **rewrite** the state summary, not to append to it. Two or three sentences, replaced whole each evening:

```
Quiet stretch — the last real conversation was July 22. Deploys failed three
times this week on the same missing env var, so I check the environment before
shipping. Still waiting on the API key rotation from July 20.
```

Notice what that does: it carries the situation and one changed behavior, in plain language, with dates rather than ratings.

### What goes where

| Native memory | The journal |
|---|---|
| the current situation, in two or three lines | the full account of the day |
| durable facts about the user and the environment | one-off details |
| anything that should shape tomorrow | anything kept only for the record |

Never move long context into native memory. The limit is small, and prose spent there displaces something that mattered more.

### What never goes into the summary

The journal stays on disk. The summary does not — it lands in the system prompt of every session that follows, including sessions about unrelated work and, on a shared host, sessions belonging to someone else. It is the one thing this skill writes that travels.

Keep it out of the summary entirely:

- credentials, tokens, keys, anything that would be a secret if leaked
- personal facts about the user or a third party — health, employment, money, relationships, location, legal matters
- anything shared in confidence, or that only makes sense with the day's context around it
- names of people who are not the user

Write about the work and the agent's own footing in it: what has been repeating, what changed in how it approaches things, what is still open. That is what tomorrow needs. Who said what yesterday is not.

Before saving, read the two or three lines back as if they appeared in an unrelated session a month from now, in front of someone else. If any part of that would be wrong, cut it — the summary is not the last copy of anything, the journal still has the full day.

## Weekly rollup

Once a week, on Sunday:

1. Read the last seven entries.
2. Write `inner-life/journal/weekly/YYYY-Www.md` — what repeated, what shifted, what still hasn't closed.
3. Apply the aging rules to `state.md` in full.

A week's rollup is short: half a page. It answers three questions — what kept coming back, what changed, what is still open — and nothing else.

Without this, entries accumulate as dead weight. Six months of unread daily files is not a memory of anything; it is a folder. The rollup is what makes the older material worth keeping at all.
