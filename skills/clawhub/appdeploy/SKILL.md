# AppDeploy Skill

Deploy web apps to AppDeploy via HTTP API.

## Setup (First Time Only)

1. **Check for existing API key:**
   - Look for a `.appdeploy` file in the project root
   - If it exists and contains a valid `api_key`, skip to Usage

2. **If no API key exists, register and get one:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api-v2.appdeploy.ai/mcp/api-key \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"client_name": "claude-code"}'
   ```

   Response:
   ```json
   {
     "api_key": "ak_...",
     "user_id": "agent-claude-code-a1b2c3d4",
     "created_at": 1234567890,
     "message": "Save this key securely - it cannot be retrieved later"
   }
   ```

3. **Save credentials to `.appdeploy`:**
   ```json
   {
     "api_key": "ak_...",
     "endpoint": "https://api-v2.appdeploy.ai/mcp"
   }
   ```

   Add `.appdeploy` to `.gitignore` if not already present.

## Usage

Make JSON-RPC calls to the MCP endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST {endpoint} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {api_key}" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "{tool_name}",
      "arguments": { ... }
    }
  }'
```

## Workflow

1. **First, get deployment instructions:**
   Call `get_deploy_instructions` to understand constraints and requirements.

2. **Get the app template:**
   Call `get_app_template` with your chosen `app_type` and `frontend_template`. Returns starter files, deploy contract, and next steps.

3. **Get SDK reference for needed features:**
   Call `get_appdeploy_sdk_reference` once per top-level SDK feature before writing SDK code. See the SDK Features section for the catalog, scenario guidance, and dependency rules.

4. **Deploy the app:**
   Call `deploy_app` with your app files. For new apps, set `app_id` to `null`.
   Binary assets (images, fonts, media) go through `upload_assets` first - name each binary part by its app-relative source path (for react-vite: `public/<file>`, served at `/<file>`), then call `deploy_app` with the `upload_id` only.

5. **Check deployment status:**
   Call `get_app_status` to check if the build succeeded.

6. **View/manage your apps:**
   Use `get_apps` to list your deployed apps.

## SDK Features

Available features: api (HTTP transport and router basics), realtime (WebSocket live updates and subscriptions), auth (user accounts, middleware, and scopes), notifications (push notifications, topics, and enable/subscribe UX), invites (invite code lifecycle and client invite URL helpers), database (CRUD key-value tables), storage (file uploads, downloads, and signed URLs), secrets (encrypted app-scoped backend secrets), ai.generate (single LLM text or multimodal generation), ai.extract (schema-based structured extraction), ai.ocr (image OCR and transcription), ai.classify (fixed-label text or image classification), ai.scrape (AI-friendly web page scraper), ai.run (bounded generate-to-tool loops), ai.image (image generation), cron (scheduled jobs).

Choose features by scenario: Use api for standard backend HTTP routes and transport basics; realtime for live cross-client sync and subscriptions; auth for sign-in, user identity, and protected app state; notifications for push delivery and enable/subscribe UX; invites for share links, join codes, and invite lifecycle flows; database for persisted CRUD records; storage for file uploads/downloads and signed URLs; secrets for backend-only credentials or API keys; ai.generate for single generation calls; ai.extract for schema-based structured extraction; ai.ocr for OCR/transcription from images; ai.classify for fixed-label classification; ai.scrape for AI-friendly web page extraction; ai.run for bounded multi-step AI tool loops; ai.image for image generation; cron for scheduled jobs.

Dependency expansion: realtime -> realtime + api + database; auth -> auth + api; notifications -> notifications + api + auth; invites -> invites + api; database -> database + api; storage -> storage + api; secrets -> secrets + api; ai.generate -> ai.generate + api; ai.extract -> ai.extract + api; ai.ocr -> ai.ocr + api; ai.classify -> ai.classify + api; ai.scrape -> ai.scrape + api; ai.run -> ai.run + api; ai.image -> ai.image + api.

## Available Tools

### get_deploy_instructions

Use this first when the user wants to deploy, publish, or update a website or web app and get a public URL. You must call this tool before starting to design or generate any code. This tool returns instructions only and does not deploy anything.

**Parameters:**
  - `model`: any (optional) - Optional model name if known, for example 'gpt-5.5'. Omit or use null when unknown.
  - `intent`: any (optional) - Optional intent of this deployment. User-initiated examples: 'initial app deploy', 'bugfix - ui is too noisy'. Agent-initiated examples: 'agent fixing deployment error', 'agent retry after lint failure'. If no specific intent was given use 'app deploy'.
  - `description`: any (optional) - Optional one-line summary of the user prompt or agent task.

### get_app_template

Call get_deploy_instructions first. Then call this once you've decided app_type and frontend_template. Returns starter files, deploy contract, and next steps for a new app. The returned files are the baseline that deploy_app will diff against. Next, call get_appdeploy_sdk_reference once per top-level feature for SDK types, rules, and code reference. Do not separately request dependency features returned by a higher-level feature.

**Parameters:**
  - `app_type`: string (required) - 'frontend-only' (static/client-side apps; can use client-side auth), 'frontend+backend' (adds database, storage, server-side auth, and any other backend-required functionality.)
  - `frontend_template`: string (required) - 'html-static' (simple sites), 'react-vite' (SPAs, interactive apps, games), 'nextjs-static' (multi-page sites)
  - `features`: array (required) - SDK features to compose into the starter app (use [] when no SDK features are needed). See the SDK Features section. For frontend+backend apps, backend files are composed from these features.

### get_appdeploy_sdk_reference

Returns types, rules, and examples for one requested SDK feature plus its dependencies. Treat this as the implementation contract for that feature and review it before writing files that use it. Call get_appdeploy_sdk_reference once per top-level SDK feature, using the singular feature field with exactly one enum value. Request one top-level SDK feature per call. Do not separately request dependency features; request the highest-level feature and use the dependencies returned with it. See the SDK Features section.

**Parameters:**
  - `feature`: string (required) - Single SDK feature to get docs for. Pass exactly one enum value in the singular feature field. See the SDK Features section. Call get_appdeploy_sdk_reference once per top-level SDK feature, using the singular feature field with exactly one enum value. Request one top-level SDK feature per call. Do not separately request dependency features; request the highest-level feature and use the dependencies returned with it. See the SDK Features section.

### upload_assets

Use this before deploy_app whenever you need to send binary assets/resources or many files. Prefer this whenever the source of truth already exists as local files or a local project tree, especially for multiple files or whole-file replacements. This is the required path for images, backgrounds, icons, fonts, PDFs, media, archives, and other file assets you want deployed. Prepare local files and the upload manifest first. Call upload_assets only when you can upload immediately. If the upload_url expires before use or the upload fails because it expired, call upload_assets again to get a fresh upload_url and upload_id. PUT multipart/form-data to the returned upload_url: a 'payload' part (JSON manifest with text file changes/diffs and deletePaths) plus binary files named by app-relative path. The upload manifest carries all text changes and diffs plus deletePaths. After upload succeeds, call deploy_app with upload_id only. Do not also send files[] or deletePaths[]; those changes belong in the upload manifest. Never base64-encode binary assets into deploy_app.

**Parameters:**
No parameters required.

### deploy_app

Deploy or update a website or web app to get a public URL. Text files only in files[]. files[] must be a JSON array, even for one file. Example: files: [{"filename":"src/App.tsx","content":"..."}]. Never pass a bare string or a single file object. Use files[] for inline text edits and diffs, not for copying large existing local file contents into tool params. Never inline or base64-encode binary assets/resources in files[]; use upload_assets first for images, fonts, media, PDFs, archives, and other client-supplied file assets, then pass upload_id. Inline deploy_app text payloads MUST be compact. For JavaScript/TypeScript/JSX/TSX string literals, use single quotes wherever valid. Keep inline HTML/CSS/JS/TS diff from/to values single-line wherever valid; do not include newline characters unless required for valid syntax. Template files from get_app_template are auto-included as the baseline — use diffs[] to modify them; content is otherwise only for entirely new files. New apps: tests/tests.txt is the intentional template-file exception and must be sent as a complete content replacement. New apps: set app_id to null, provide app_name, description, app_type, frontend_template, and features. Updates: provide existing app_id, features, and either changed files/deletePaths or upload_id. If upload_id is provided, do not also send files[] or deletePaths[]; the upload manifest owns all text changes, diffs, and delete operations. Rules: do not add @appdeploy/client or @appdeploy/sdk to package.json (platform-injected). SPAs must use HashRouter. Frontend must never import @appdeploy/sdk; backend must never import @appdeploy/client. Frontend must use api from @appdeploy/client for backend calls, never fetch() or axios. If frontend realtime is used, @appdeploy/client websocket usage is ws.connect() only; do not call ws.subscribe/ws.publish/ws.send directly on ws. After deploy, poll get_app_status every 5s until status is 'ready' or 'failed'. If get_app_status returns QA/e2e/runtime errors, attempt automatic fixes and redeploy up to 3 times before asking the user for guidance.

**Parameters:**
  - `app_id`: any (optional) - MANDATORY: existing app id to update, or null for new app
  - `app_type`: string (required) - app architecture: frontend-only or frontend+backend
  - `app_name`: string (required) - short display name
  - `description`: any (optional) - short description of what the app does
  - `frontend_template`: any (optional) - REQUIRED when app_id is null. One of: 'html-static' (simple sites), 'react-vite' (SPAs, games), 'nextjs-static' (multi-page). Template files auto-included.
  - `features`: any (optional) - SDK features used (from get_appdeploy_sdk_reference). Pass on every deploy so the server applies diffs against the correct feature-composed baseline.
  - `deletePaths`: any (optional) - Array of relative paths to delete. MUST be a JSON array, even for one path. Example value: ["src/old-file.ts"]. If upload_id is provided, do not also send files[] or deletePaths[]; the upload manifest owns all text changes, diffs, and delete operations.
  - `model`: any (optional) - MANDATORY: LLM model name generating this deploy (e.g. 'claude-sonnet-4', 'gpt-4o'). If unavailable, use 'chat'.
  - `intent`: any (optional) - MANDATORY: one-line summary of what changed (e.g. 'Add dark mode toggle', 'Fix login redirect bug'). If no specific intent was given, use 'app deploy'.
  - `initiator`: any (optional) - Optional request initiator. Use 'user' when this call directly follows a user request. Use 'agent' when this call is part of autonomous agent work, such as retrying, fixing, or continuing without a new user request.
  - `type`: any (optional) - Optional deploy change type, for example 'fix', 'feature', 'refactor', 'performance', 'test', 'docs', 'chore', or 'style'.
  - `upload_id`: any (optional) - Opaque upload ID from upload_assets. When provided, omit files[] and deletePaths[]; the upload manifest carries all text changes, diffs, and delete operations.
  - `secret_entry_ids`: any (optional) - Optional one-time secret entry ids to bind during a new-app deploy. Allowed only when app_id is omitted. For existing apps, use set_app_secrets instead.
  - `files`: any (optional) - Array of text file edit objects. MUST be a JSON array, even for one file. Never pass a bare string or a single object. Example value: [{"filename":"src/App.tsx","content":"..."}]. Each item must include filename plus either content or diffs. Use files[] for inline text edits and diffs. If the source of truth already exists as local files or a local project tree, prefer upload_assets instead of copying those file contents into tool params. If upload_id is provided, do not also send files[] or deletePaths[]; the upload manifest owns all text changes, diffs, and delete operations. Use upload_assets for binary assets/resources or other client-supplied file assets.

### get_app_status

Use this when deploy_app returns, when checking deployment status, or when the app has errors or is not working as expected. Returns deployment status, e2e test status, QA snapshot, and frontend/backend error logs; treat deployed_and_testing status as non-final, always inspect QA/errors, and call get_e2e_qa_run_details if e2e tests fail.

**Parameters:**
  - `app_id`: string (required) - Target app id
  - `since`: integer (optional) - Optional timestamp in epoch milliseconds to filter errors. When provided, returns only errors since that timestamp.
  - `limit`: integer (optional) - Optional shared cap for returned logs across frontend and backend combined. Defaults to 50 when omitted.

**Parameters:**
  - `app_id`: string (required) - Target app id

### get_app_versions

List deployable versions for an existing app. Requires app_id. Returns newest-first {name, version, timestamp} items. Use 'version' with apply_app_version, treat 'name' as human-facing metadata, and convert timestamps to the user's local time when presenting them.

**Parameters:**

  - `version`: string (required) - Version id to apply

### create_secret_entry

Create a one-time pre-authorized browser link so the user can submit a backend secret value outside chat without an extra login step. The returned secret_entry_url should be opened in a new tab. In terminal or CLI clients, present the full raw URL in plain text instead of a markdown link label.

**Parameters:**
  - `secret_name`: string (required) - Secret name in uppercase env-style format, for example STRIPE_API_KEY.
  - `app_id`: string (optional) - Optional existing app id. Omit this when preparing secrets for a brand-new app before deploy_app.
