Extracted from telegram_listener.py so peck-only boxes get the same nudge.
Before this, the check lived only in the telegram listener's pulse thread, so
a duck running just peck_listener.py (Josh's laptop is the reference case) had
no update path at all and would sit on an old version indefinitely.

One implementation, two callers. Never raises: both callers run it from a
long-lived loop that must not be able to die.
