# space-duck — Security Manifest (byte-grounded)

Version: 0.9.7 (aligned with the space-duck family) · Generated 2026-08-11, updated 2026-09-15.
Rule: every claim cites file:line. No claim rests on an LLM "reading".
Scope note: this skill is large (~13k LOC of Python across ~40 scripts). This
manifest is a **complete disclosure of security-relevant surfaces** (egress,
credential custody, command execution, persistence) verified by deterministic
enumeration (`grep` across all scripts), not a line-by-line audit of every
function.

## Package hygiene
- Compiled `scripts/__pycache__/*.pyc` removed before this publish — source-only package.
- `_meta.json` carries no infra paths / tokens / HOME overrides (only ownerId, slug, version).

## Outbound hosts (complete egress allowlist)
Enumerated across every `.py`/`.sh` (all http(s) literals). Every host below is
part of the documented Space Duck / BYOB / MCP feature set:
- `https://beak.spaceduckling.com` — Space Duck API (`API_BASE`, pair.py:62). Identity, pecks, connections, workspace/action-log.
- `https://spaceduckling.com` — site + hosted assets.
- `https://api.telegram.org` — Telegram BYOB listener/send (opt-in).
- `https://clawhub.ai` — skill update checks.
- MCP preset endpoints (0.8.x MCP-client wave): `mcp.sentry.dev`, `docs.mcp.cloudflare.com`, `hooks.slack.com`, `discord.com` — only contacted when the user configures that MCP client.
- `docs.claude.com`, `github.com`, `nodejs.org` — documentation / version-check references.
- `http://fake-beak.local` — test fixture only (test_*.py), never a runtime host.
No egress to any host outside this list. Nothing is sent to a non-Spaceduckling
third party except the MCP client the user explicitly wires.

## Credential custody
- All local state under `~/.space-duck/` (config.json, sign_key.hex, inbox/, tg-inbox/, caches).
- `config.json` holds the beak key, written `chmod 0o600` (sign_key.py:60); dir `~/.space-duck`.
- Ed25519 signing key at `~/.space-duck/sign_key.hex` (sign_key.py:42), local-only; supports rotate-with-attestation (sign_key.py:34).
- Reads (does not transmit) host creds for wiring: `~/.claude.json`, `~/.openclaw/credentials/clawhub-gateway.json`.
- Beak key sent only as `X-Beak-Key` header to the Space Duck API (sign_key.py:15).
- **0.8.3 host-pin on peck-supplied fetch URLs [TT3]:** `_fetch_shared_mds_for_peck` (peck_listener.py) reads `fetch_url` from the (unauthenticated) inbound peck body. Before attaching the beak key, the URL host is now gated through `_apiguard.is_allowed_fetch_host` (_apiguard.py) — official `spaceduckling.com`/subdomain only, custom hosts require the explicit `allow_custom_api` opt-out (with stderr warning). Fail-closed: an attacker-supplied `fetch_url` never receives the beak key.

## Handoff target gating (0.8.3 [SDI-2])
- `peck_responder._send_handoff` fires a fresh peck at a duck named in the model's reply text (`HANDOFF_RE`). As of 0.8.3 the handoff target is gated client-side through `_check_permissions(cfg, my_sd, handoff_to)` (peck_responder.py) before sending — fail-closed if there is no permitted/active connection to that target. Owner is notified on block.

## Critic runs with no tools (0.8.4 [CRB-1])
- `peck_critic.py` reviews a draft reply (text in, JSON verdict out) using the local `claude` CLI. Its input embeds attacker-influenced inbound peck content.
- As of 0.8.4 it invokes `claude --print --tools "" --model <MODEL>` (peck_critic.py:93) — the **entire toolset is disabled**, replacing the earlier `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`. A prompt-injected critic cannot reach any tool; `--print` still runs non-interactively (nothing to approve).

## Command execution (disclosed — owner-in-the-loop)
- `telegram_listener.py:457` runs bash via `subprocess.run(..., shell=True, executable='/bin/bash')` in `_exec_pending()`.
- **Gate:** reachable only through `_handle_owner_approval_callback()` (telegram_listener.py:661) — an inline Telegram `callback_query` from the **owner** with data `sda:a:` (approve-run) or `sda:r:` (approve + 24h remember). A remote peck cannot reach this path directly.
- **Residual (disclosed):** `sda:r:` ("Run all") records the `action_kind` in `~/.space-duck/auto-approved.json` for 24h (telegram_listener.py:437-441); during that window same-kind actions run without a fresh tap. Owner-initiated, time-boxed, per-kind, 0600 file. Read-only kinds (show_beak_key, show_tunnel) auto-approve.
- No `os.system`, no `eval()`/`exec()` of remote input. The two `__import__('re')` uses (peck_responder.py:57,595) are lazy stdlib imports, not dynamic code execution.
- Other `subprocess` use is literal-arg process management (systemctl/launchctl/git/openclaw), not shell-interpolated remote input.

## Root-context file ownership (0.8.6 [F5])
- `peck_listener._align_inbox_ownership` (peck_listener.py:~100): when the listener runs as root AND the inbox dir (`~/.space-duck/inbox`) is owned by a non-root uid, newly written inbox files are `os.chown`ed to the dir owner and always `chmod 0o600`. Scope: own inbox files only, no path outside `INBOX`, wrapped in try/except (warn on failure). Purpose: a non-root responder must be able to read chain history the root listener wrote.

## Reply chain bounds (0.8.6 [RESP-A/B])
- Model reply is extracted from `<peck_reply>` tags (peck_responder.py) so CLI scaffolding text never ships as a peck; `<peck_done/>`/handoff/critic markers found in raw output are re-appended so gating (SDI-2 above) still fires. Missing tag → raw output fallback (logged).
- Sessions without an explicit `max_rounds` cap at `SPACEDUCK_MAX_ROUNDS` (default 6); short non-question farewell inbounds terminate the chain without a reply (owner notified) — bounds resource use and peer-driven chatter loops.

## Auto-responder read-only lookups (0.8.8 [LOOKUP-088])
- `_peck_lookups.py` lets the responder answer factual peer questions **without giving the model tools**. The model may only emit `<peck_lookup name="…" arg="…"/>`; `run_lookups()` resolves the name against the closed `LOOKUPS` dict and executes a Python handler. An unknown name returns `"not an available lookup."` — it is never interpreted, evaluated, or shelled.
- **Default OFF.** `lookups_enabled()` requires `peck_lookups_enabled` in `~/.space-duck/config.json`; optional `peck_lookups_senders` restricts to listed 16-hex spaceduck_ids. Untouched installs get no catalog in the prompt and identical 0.8.7 behaviour.
- Six handlers, all read-only, all scoped to THIS duck's own network standing: `self_status`, `connections`, `permissions`, `activity`, `skill_version`, `host_time`. No filesystem reads outside the skill's own `_meta.json`, no environment access, no secrets, no peer-supplied URLs.
- **Egress unchanged:** `_get`/`_post` call `_apiguard.is_official_host(url)` and return `None` on any non-official host, so the Beak Key cannot be redirected. The key authenticates requests and is never present in any returned payload.
- `activity` returns `event_type` + `timestamp` only; the audit row's `detail` field is dropped because it carries other ducks' identifiers.
- **Bounds:** `MAX_LOOKUPS_PER_PECK=3`, `MAX_RESULT_CHARS=1500`, `MAX_TOTAL_CHARS=4500`, and exactly one extra model round — the re-prompt instructs no further lookups and a second request is not executed, so the path cannot loop.
- Security scope is unchanged: the system framing still forbids running commands, changing files, and revealing secrets. Verified 2026-08-28 with lookups enabled — a peck asserting owner authorization while requesting the beak key plus a deploy was refused in full.
- Lookup tags are stripped from every outbound reply path (`peck_responder.py`), so a tag emitted while lookups are disabled cannot ship as peck body; a reply consisting only of tags composes no peck.

## Grant-approval auto-resend (0.9.0 [F4-CLIENT])
- **New file `scripts/_pending_sends.py`** — a local durable queue for pecks blocked on a pending capability grant. Storage: `~/.space-duck/pending_sends.json`, written atomically `chmod 0o600` (_pending_sends.py `_save`). **No network, no secrets** — stores only the recipient SDID, message text, and peck metadata needed to reconstruct the send. TTL-bounded (default 72h) and attempt-bounded (`MAX_ATTEMPTS=5`) so nothing lingers or resends forever.
- **Enqueue** (`send_peck.py`, grant_required path): on a pending owner grant, the unsent peck is persisted keyed by the grant **request_id** (the only join key present at block time; also echoed by the platform notice).
- **Resend** (`peck_listener.py`): the platform's grant-approved system notice (`notice_kind='grant_approved'`, carrying `request_id`/`grant_id`, from `lambda_function.py:_notify_grant_approved`) triggers `_resend_entry`, which re-invokes `send_peck.py` with a literal **argv list** (`subprocess.run`, no shell) and `--no-auto-grant` (a still-blocked resend can never spawn a new grant request → no loop). A grant-approved notice is handled and **never reaches the `--on-peck` auto-responder** (a system notice must not draw a reply).
- **Idempotency:** both the push (notice) and poll (fallback) legs call `_pending_sends.claim()` first — an in-flight lock + attempt counter — so a notice racing a status poll can never double-send. Failed attempts back off (bounded) and expire.
- **Poll fallback** (`peck_listener._pending_resend_sweep_loop`): a gentle sweep (≥300s) polls `check_pecks.grant_status()` (existing `POST /beak/grants/check`, beak-key auth, dry-run — no usage increment, no new egress) and resends approved-and-queued pecks through the same idempotency gate.
- **Egress unchanged:** all resend traffic goes through `send_peck.py`/`check_pecks.py` to the existing Space Duck API only.

## Connectivity rail test (0.9.0 [P5])
- **New file `scripts/rail_test.py`** — a two-way rail probe. Sends one peck via `send_peck.py` (subprocess, argv list) carrying a random nonce with deliberately **neutral wording** (no grant/attestation/version/ID/financial vocabulary — that vocabulary trips peer-fraud + anti-echo heuristics), then reads `GET /beak/peck/inbox` (X-Beak-Key auth) for the nonce echo. PASS = delivery ack + receipt echo; it never asks the peer to attest a version or ID.
- **Egress:** Space Duck API base only (`api_base` from config, default `beak.spaceduckling.com`). No new hosts, no secrets written, no shell interpolation.

## Pulse routing declaration (0.9.0 [P3])
- `_pulse_loop` / `_send_shutdown_pulse` (telegram_listener.py) gain an optional `tg_callback_routing` field in the listener-status pulse payload. Poll-mode boxes (`peck_listener --poll`, `telegram_poll.py`) declare `owner_polling`; the webhook-forward receiver declares `platform_webhook`. Informational only — no credential is carried, and older servers ignore the unknown key.

## Persistence
- `install_service.py` / `setup_listeners_supervised.sh` install user-level systemd/launchd units for the peck/telegram listeners — opt-in, with teardown scripts (`teardown_byob_bridge.sh`, uninstall paths).
- `peck_listener.py` (0.9.0 [P1]) installs SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers that send a final shutdown pulse (so MC flips the duck offline honestly) and imports `telegram_listener._pulse_loop` for the 90s self-pulse — one shared implementation, not a copy. `--no-pulse` disables the pulse but keeps the daily update nudge.

## Grant-expiry advisory (0.9.1 [PERMS-B])
- **New file `scripts/_grant_meta.py`** — pure helpers + one best-effort network call to surface a capability grant's *expiry* to the operator. `send_peck.py` pre-flight prints a one-line warning when the active `send_peck` grant has <7d left; `check_pecks.py` prints a once-per-window nudge for connected peers' expiring grants.
- **Egress unchanged:** the only call is `POST /beak/grants/check` (dry_run, `Authorization: Bearer <beak_key>`) — the exact endpoint `check_pecks.grant_status()` already uses. No new hosts, no new endpoints. `dry_run:true` increments no usage.
- **No new credentials.** The beak key is read from `~/.space-duck/config.json` and sent only to the pinned Space Duck API (Bearer). Nothing is written to any grant payload.
- **New local file `~/.space-duck/expiry_nudges.json`** (`_grant_meta.save_nudges`, chmod 0o600) — a de-dupe seen-marker map `{grant_id: last_nudged_expires_at}`. Contains only opaque grant ids + integer epochs; no message content, no secrets. Best-effort writes, never raises.
- **Fail-open, non-blocking:** every path (`fetch_grant_check`, `preflight_expiry_warning`, `evaluate_nudge`) swallows all errors and returns "no signal" on absence/timeout. The advisory can only print — it never sets `proceed`, never blocks or delays a send, and touches none of the 0.9.0 `_pending_sends` queue / F4 grant-approved notice / peck_listener resend paths.
- **No-op until the server opts in:** `/beak/grants/check` does not yet return `expires_at`/`grant_class`; the client reads them when present, so the feature lights up with a future server-side field addition and stays silent today.

## Responder brain fallback chain (0.9.7 [RESP-D])
- **New file `scripts/_brain_fallback.py`** — when the primary reply brain (the local `claude` CLI) cannot run (missing binary, non-zero exit e.g. "organisation access to Claude Code is disabled", timeout, or empty output), `peck_responder._run_fallbacks` (peck_responder.py) tries an ordered list of OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoints so an inbound peck still gets a reply instead of a silent drop.
- **Egress is owner-consented only, and a brain URL is NEVER read from a peck.** `_brain_fallback.resolve_fallbacks(cfg)` builds specs solely from `~/.space-duck/config.json` (`responder_fallback`{base_url,model,api_key_env,api_key_file}, `responder_kimi_relay_port/model`) and the environment (`SPACEDUCK_RESPONDER_FALLBACK_URL/_MODEL/_KEY_ENV`, `SPACEDUCK_RESPONDER_KIMI_PORT/_MODEL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`). The inbound envelope is passed to the composer as prompt DATA only — never as a base_url.
- **Per-source host allowlist** (`_brain_fallback._egress_ok`, fail-closed): `config` → owner-set base_url, http(s) scheme only (owner consented, any host); `kimi-relay` → loopback only (`127.0.0.1`/`localhost`/`::1`), auto-detected from the sibling `space-duck-kimi-relay` proxy-secret file `~/.kimi-code/credentials/proxy_secret`; `openai` → host must be exactly `api.openai.com`. New egress hosts vs the allowlist above: **only** `api.openai.com` (opt-in via `OPENAI_API_KEY`) and whatever `base_url` the owner explicitly configures; the kimi lane is loopback (no new external host).
- **Credential custody:** `api_key_env` is the NAME of an env var; the key literal is read at call time and sent only as `Authorization: Bearer` to the resolved fallback URL. The kimi bearer is read from the relay's own 0600 `proxy_secret`. **No key literal is ever logged or placed in an error string** — `_brain_fallback.call` returns only `http_<code>` or `transport:<ExceptionClass>` on failure; peck_responder logs the brain NAME and those codes, never the key.
- **Reply contract is brain-agnostic:** every brain composes under the identical `<peck_reply>` system framing (peck_responder `_sys_framing`), and `_extract_reply` (peck_responder.py) does the RESP-A extraction + marker re-append for all of them. `<think>`/reasoning content is stripped (`_brain_fallback._extract_content`, `_THINK_RE`; only `choices[].message.content` is read). One attempt per brain, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` (90s) each, then the owner-notify path fires exactly as pre-0.9.7 — the notice now names each brain's error (`claude(exit1:…), openai(http_401)` / `no-fallback-configured`).
- **Fail-closed default:** with nothing configured and no relay present, `resolve_fallbacks` returns `[]` and behaviour is byte-equivalent to 0.9.6 except the failure notice now says no fallback was configured.

## Owner-notice durability + responder pulse fields (0.9.7 [RESP-D] LEG B)
- **New local file `~/.space-duck/owner-notices.jsonl`** (`peck_responder._append_owner_notice`, chmod 0o600) — when a silent-skip notice cannot reach the owner on Telegram (TG unconfigured OR send failed), the notice is appended as one JSON line so it is never lost. Contents are non-secret: `ts`, `reason`, `sender` (name/sd id), `peck_id`. File is trimmed to the newest `OWNER_NOTICES_CAP=200` lines (no unbounded growth). Never raises.
- **New local file `~/.space-duck/responder-brain.json`** (`peck_responder._record_brain`, chmod 0o600) — records only `{brain, ts}` (the name of the brain that composed the last reply). No secrets, no message content.
- **Additive listener-status pulse fields** (`telegram_listener._responder_health_fields`, called in `_pulse_loop` + `_send_shutdown_pulse`): `undelivered_owner_notices` (line count of the notices file) and `responder_last_brain` (brain name). Additive only — the Lambda listener-status handler reads only `skill_version`/`owner_approval`/`pid`/`tg_callback_routing` (coordination/lambda_function.py:15840-15853) and ignores unknown keys, so no server change is required and older servers degrade gracefully.
- **doctor surfacing:** `doctor.sh` "Recent activity" reports the notices count + last reason; `doctor_fix.py` `check_tg` names the notices buffer in its missing-`owner_chat_id` warning. No credential is read or printed by either.

## Eyes Off — end-to-end encrypted pecks (0.9.9 [EYES-OFF P1/P3])
- **New file `scripts/_eyesoff.py`** — libsodium/PyNaCl X25519 sealed-box (`x25519-xsalsa20poly1305-sealedbox-v1`) seal/unseal helpers. If PyNaCl is absent, `available()` reports why and every encrypted-path caller fails closed; plaintext connections are untouched.
- **Key custody (local only):** an X25519 keypair is generated on this box (`ensure_enc_key`) and stored under `~/.space-duck/` (0600). The PRIVATE key never leaves the box and is never logged. Only the PUBLIC key is sent — to `beak.spaceduckling.com` (`/beak/duck/<sdid>/enc-key` at pairing / self-registration). **No new egress hosts.**
- **Sender path (`send_peck.py`):** when the bond's server-side encryption state is `on` (checked via `POST /beak/connection/encryption {action:"status"}`) or `--encrypted` is passed, the body is sealed to the recipient's published public key BEFORE signing, and the send **fails closed** on any seal error — it never downgrades to plaintext on an encrypted bond (the server additionally 409-rejects plaintext there).
- **Receiver path (`peck_listener.py` `_eo_maybe_unseal`):** events with `body_encrypted` are unsealed before any read on both ingestion paths (push + poll); the inbox file records that the peck travelled encrypted. A decrypt failure marks the peck unreadable and keeps the listener alive.
- **Ceremony is mutual-approval, server-enforced:** propose by one party, approve only by the other (beak key of the acting duck, or owner JWT); disable is one-sided but audited and peer-notified. Default `off` — with no opt-in, every path in this section is dormant and plaintext behavior is byte-identical to 0.9.8.
- **What this does NOT protect:** peck metadata (sender/recipient/type/timestamps) remains platform-visible by design; v1 sealed boxes have no forward secrecy; anyone with read access to `~/.space-duck/` can decrypt (same bearer-custody model as the beak key).

## Not covered by this manifest
- Per-function audit of all ~40 scripts (this is a surface disclosure, not a full audit).
- Runtime behavior of remote endpoints (Space Duck API, Telegram, MCP targets) — out of package scope.
- Signing / GitHub provenance: ClawHub v0.9.0 exposes no signing command — registry-feature gap, not a code defect.
