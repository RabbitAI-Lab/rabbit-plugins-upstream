## 1. Coding Laws

**Pre-Commit Checklist:** syntax clean, tests pass, type hints, no bare except, no hardcoded secrets, f-string (not format()), pathlib (not os.path), docstrings, functions <= 30 lines.

**File Structure:** <= 300 lines per file, <= 30 lines per function, one thing per function.

**Error Handling:** async ops must have error handling, network requests must timeout, user input must be validated, external deps assumed to fail.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Rationalization | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "Write now, refactor later" | Later never comes. |
| "Just one line, no need to check" | Small diffs push files past boundaries. |
| "AI-generated code is probably fine" | AI code needs more scrutiny. |
| "Tests pass, it is good" | Tests dont catch architecture or security issues. |

---

## 2. Spec-Driven Development

**Law: NO CODE WITHOUT AN APPROVED SPEC.**

**9 Mandatory Sections:** Title/Metadata, Context, Functional Requirements (RFC 2119), Non-Functional Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Edge Cases, API Contract, Data Model, Out of Scope.

**4-Phase Gated Workflow:** SPECIFY -> PLAN -> TASKS -> IMPLEMENT (each reviewed by human)

**Stop-and-Ask Rules:** Scope creep, >30% ambiguity, breaking changes, security implications, unknown performance.

**Anti-Rationalization:**
| Rationalization | Reality |
| "Clear requirements, no spec needed" | Clear reqs take 5 min. Unclear ones need it. |
| "Quick prototype first" | The prototype is the final product. |
| "Specs are too slow" | Specs save 10x refactoring time. |
| "I will document later" | Later never comes. |

---

## 3. Planning and Task Breakdown

Each task <= 30 min, independently testable, with clear AC. Slicing strategies: Vertical (preferred), Contract-First, Risk-First.

---

## 4. Incremental Implementation

**Cycle:** Implement -> Test -> Verify -> Commit -> Next slice

**Anti-Rationalization:** "Writing everything at once is faster" -> 500 lines untested = 10x debugging. "Just a few lines, no need to commit separately" -> atomic commits make rollback/review clean. "I will test later" -> never happens.

---

## 5. Test-Driven Development + E2E

**TDD Cycle:** RED (write failing test) -> GREEN (min code to pass) -> REFACTOR (clean up)

**Prove-It Pattern:** Write test reproducing bug (RED) -> Fix bug (GREEN) -> Write regression test -> Refactor

**E2E Silent-Pass Detection:** toBeDefined()/not.toBeNull() on Locator always passes. Use toBeVisible()/toHaveText().

**P0 Anti-patterns:** toBeDefined() on Locator, forgotten it.only, empty catch blocks, un-awaited async.

**Anti-Rationalization:** "Tests pass, it is good" -> tests dont catch architecture/security. "AI-generated code is fine" -> needs more scrutiny. "Write code first, add tests later" -> tests what code does, not what it should do.

---

## 6. Context Engineering

**From: ratel-ai/ratel (351 star) + NeoLabHQ/context-engineering-kit (1.3k star)**

**Core Principle: Progressive Disclosure** - Load only what each turn needs.

**Context Hierarchy:** 1. Rules Files (persistent) -> 2. Spec/Arch (per feature) -> 3. Source Files (per task) -> 4. Error Output (per iteration) -> 5. History (accumulates, compacts)

**Ratel-Style Catalog:** All skills in SkillCatalog, tools in ToolCatalog. Each turn loads only matching ones.

**Anti-Rationalization:** "All rules in system prompt" -> noise reduces accuracy. "Same project, no need to separate" -> different modules need different context. "Write rules once" -> projects evolve.

---

## 7. Doubt-Driven Development

**From: addyosmani/agent-skills -- doubt-driven-development**

A confident answer is not a correct one. For non-trivial decisions (branching logic, crossing boundaries, unverifiable assertions, irreversible blast radius).

**Doubt Cycle:** 1. CLAIM (write claim + why matters) -> 2. EXTRACT (isolate artifact) -> 3. DOUBT (fresh-context adversarial review) -> 4. RECONCILE (classify findings) -> 5. STOP (trivial findings, 3 cycles, or user override)

**Anti-Rationalization:** "This is obviously correct" -> hides most dangerous assumptions. "Tests pass" -> only cover known scenarios. "No time" -> doubt cycle is faster than debugging.

---

## 8. Bug Fixing (Focused-Fix)

**Law: NO FIXES WITHOUT SCOPE -> TRACE -> DIAGNOSE FIRST.**

**Phase 1: SCOPE** - Identify feature, find files, understand purpose.
**Phase 2: TRACE** - Map inbound dependencies (imports) and outbound (who imports this).
**Phase 3: DIAGNOSE** - Risk tags: HIGH (public API/DB schema/security), MED (internal module), LOW (isolated file).
**Phase 4: FIX** - Dependencies -> Types -> Logic -> Tests -> Integration. Fix one at a time, run tests after each.
**Phase 5: VERIFY** - Feature tests -> referencing tests -> full suite.

---

## 9. PR Review (5-Axis + Anti-Rationalization)

**From: addyosmani/agent-skills -- code-review-and-quality**

**Axis 1: Correctness** - Matches spec? Edge cases? Error paths? Tests pass?
**Axis 2: Readability & Simplicity** - Descriptive names? Straightforward flow? Logical organization? No clever tricks? Lines can be reduced? Abstractions earning complexity?
**Axis 3: Architecture** - Fits system design? Clean boundaries? No circular deps? Appropriate abstraction?
**Axis 4: Security** - Input validated? Secrets safe? Auth checked? SQL parameterized? XSS prevented?
**Axis 5: Performance** - N+1 queries? Large object allocations? Uncached hot paths?

**Output Format:** Blast radius, per-axis assessment, severity labels (CRITICAL/REQUIRED/NIT), verdict (Approve/Request changes).

**Anti-Rationalization:** 9-item table covering "It works, good enough", "I wrote it, I know it is correct", "Clean up later", "AI-generated code is fine", "Tests pass", "Refactor makes it cleaner", "Just a small addition", "Just a version bump".

---

## 10. Code Simplification

**From: addyosmani/agent-skills -- code-simplification**

**Principles:** Chestertons Fence, Rule of 500 (>500 lines = decompose), reduce complexity not relocate it.

**Checklist:** Dead code? Conditionals can be simplified? Duplicate code? Complex expressions named? Nesting flattened? Single responsibility? Abstraction worth it? More code deleted than added?

---

## 11. Security Hardening

**From: addyosmani/agent-skills -- security-and-hardening**

**OWASP Top 10 Prevention:** SQL injection, XSS, auth, authorization, sensitive data, config security, dependency scanning, logging.

**3-Tier Boundary:** External (untrusted, validate all) -> Service (semi-trusted, auth) -> Internal (trusted, business logic).

---

## 12. Performance Optimization

**From: addyosmani/agent-skills -- performance-optimization**

**Measure First, Optimize Second:** Baseline -> Hypothesize -> Validate -> Optimize -> Verify -> Repeat.

**Checklist:** N+1 queries? Repeated computation? Large objects? Sync blocking? Caching? Lazy loading? Bundle size? Indexes? Connection pool?

---

## 13. Ship Gate and Deployment

**From: addyosmani/agent-skills -- shipping-and-launch**

**Pre-Launch Checklist:** All tests pass, code review approved, no P0/P1 vulns, CHANGELOG updated, version bumped, DB migrations forward-compatible, rollback plan, monitoring configured, docs updated, performance baseline, feature flags, staged rollout plan.

---

## 14. Git Workflow and Versioning

**From: addyosmani/agent-skills -- git-workflow-and-versioning**

**Principles:** Trunk-based development, atomic commits, ~100 lines per PR, commit as save point.

**Convention:** <type>: <description> (feat/fix/refactor/chore/docs/test/ci)

**Anti-Rationalization:** "Commit first, organize later" -> commit history IS code history. "One PR for everything" -> no one reviews large PRs. "Long feature branch is fine" -> merge hell.

---

## 15. CI/CD Pipeline and Automation

**From: addyosmani/agent-skills -- ci-cd-and-automation**

**Stages:** Lint -> Type check -> Unit test -> Integration test -> Build -> Security scan -> Deploy

**Gates:** Lint 0 errors (block), Unit test 100% (block), Coverage >=80% (block), Security scan 0 critical (block), Build success (block).

---

## 16. API Design Review

**REST:** kebab-case plural nouns (/api/v1/users). HTTP methods: GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (replace), PATCH (partial), DELETE (remove).

**5-Dimension Score:** Consistency (30%), Documentation (20%), Security (20%), Usability (15%), Performance (15%).

---

## 17. Database Design

**Principles:** Plural table names, UUID PK, created_at/updated_at, soft delete optional, indexes on query conditions, explicit FKs, forward-compatible migrations.

**Performance Checklist:** Indexes used? N+1 queries? Reasonable joins? Cursor pagination? Correct transaction scope?

---

## 18. Observability Design

**Three Pillars:** Structured logging, business metrics (latency/error rate/throughput), distributed tracing.

**Health Endpoints:** GET /health (liveness), GET /health/ready (readiness), GET /health/debug (internal only).

---

## 19. Code Migration

**Strategies:** Direct replacement (high risk, small module), Parallel run (medium, need rollback), Gradual (low, large system), Abstraction layer (low, dual maintenance).

**Flow:** Inventory -> Impact analysis -> Compatibility layer -> Execute -> Verify -> Cleanup

---

## 20. Tech Debt Tracking

**Classification:** Architecture (HIGH), Code quality (MED), Testing (HIGH), Documentation (LOW), Infrastructure (MED).

**Entry Format:** Type, Location, Description, Impact, Estimate, Created.

---

## 21. De-AI-Writing Check

**Tier 1 (Always Flag):** leverage/use, utilize/utilize, implement/build, nevertheless/but, furthermore/and, commence/start, endeavor/try.

**Tier 2 (Cluster Flag):** robust/reliable, seamless/smooth, facilitate/help, granular/detailed, holistic/complete, ecosystem/system.

**Tier 3 (High Density):** cutting-edge/modern, state-of-the-art/best available, game-changer/big change.

**Detection Flow:** First pass (flag all Tier 1) -> Structure check -> Rhythm check -> Second pass -> Output

---

## 22. Self Evaluation

**Two-Axis:** Task Difficulty (Low/Medium/High) x Execution Quality (Poor/Adequate/Strong) -> Score 1-5.

**Forced Counter-Argument:** Before final score, write reasons for lower, reasons for higher, then resolve.

**Inflation Detection:** 4+ of last 5 same score -> flag inflation. 3 consecutive 4s -> stricter evaluation.

---

## 23. Language Quick Reference

**Python:** snake_case, type hints, pathlib, f-strings, try/except/raise.
**TypeScript:** camelCase, PascalCase for types, interfaces, async/await with try/catch.
**Go:** camelCase, capitalized exports, error wrapping with fmt.Errorf.%w.
**PowerShell:** Verb-Noun naming, CmdletBinding, ErrorAction Stop.
