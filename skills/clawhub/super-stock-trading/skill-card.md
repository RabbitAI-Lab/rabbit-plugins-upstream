### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT-0 <br>


## Use Case: <br>
External users and developers use this skill to organize A-share market research, generate trading-plan and review reports, evaluate holdings, and apply documented risk gates before any user-confirmed trading decision. It is documented for learning and research use and does not provide direct broker execution. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
China A-share market; review local securities regulations before use in other jurisdictions <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: The skill can guide trading decisions, and the security summary identifies high-impact trading-execution ambiguity. <br>
Mitigation: Treat all trading outputs as research support only, require manual broker-side confirmation, and do not rely on the skill as investment advice. <br>
Risk: The installer can add third-party skills and dependencies to the local agent environment. <br>
Mitigation: Review the listed repositories and dependency installation behavior before running the installer; skip optional installer steps unless needed. <br>
Risk: API keys may be requested for market data integrations. <br>
Mitigation: Avoid storing real API keys in config.json or shell startup files; prefer environment-specific secret handling and keep credentials out of public repositories. <br>
