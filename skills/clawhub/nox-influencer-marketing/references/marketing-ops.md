## Outreach Routing

- For NoxInfluencer platform email outreach, do not call `creator contacts` first. Create or select an email task, add search/profile result `creator_id` values with `email recipients add/replace`, save user-approved content with `email content save`, set sender if needed, read back task and recipients, then ask for final approval before `email send --force` or `email schedule --force`.
- Use `creator contacts` only when the user explicitly wants visible/exported contact info or outreach outside NoxInfluencer. If the user vaguely asks to "find emails and send", choose platform email by default and say exported email retrieval uses extra contact quota.
- Email attachments belong to the email task primary project. Upload approved files with `email attachments upload <task_id> --file <path>` before `email send` or `email schedule`; use `email attachments list/delete` to inspect or remove files. Email tasks support at most 1 attachment, max 10MB. Uploading or deleting an attachment cancels an existing scheduled send, so read back the task and confirm again before scheduling.
- For one email task's reply reporting, use `email report <task_id>`. For multi-task or team-level reporting, use `email team-summary`; for SaaS team member breakdown, use `email team-breakdown`. Treat `reply_count` as email tracking replies, `replied_creator_count` as replied creators, and `inbound_message_count` as inbound reply messages. Team filters use SaaS team member `uid`, not Gmail or enterprise sender mailbox accounts. Do not recompute replies by manually scanning message threads unless the user explicitly asks for raw thread inspection.
- If the user wants in-platform DM/message, `message send` and `message schedule` require an existing `thread_id`. If the user only has an email task ID, use `message list --business_kind email_task --business_id <task_id>` to resolve the thread first. Without a thread, say that starting a new message thread is not exposed by the CLI and offer the email-task path for platform creators.
- For message-center filtering by task creator or team member, first run `message creator-filters`, then use returned `user_uid` values with `message list --creator_uids` or `message project-filters --creator_uids`.
- For message-center pending work, trust `needs_reply` / `last_message_direction`; `deal` is not the same as `unread`. If one opened task is already replied but SaaS still shows pending, inspect sibling tasks with `message projects <thread_id>`. If the user says a pending message needs no reply, do not send an empty reply or archive the channel; say task-level mark-handled is not exposed yet.
- Message attachments are thread-draft attachments. Upload files with `message attachments upload <thread_id> --file <path>` before `message send` or `message schedule`; use `message attachments list/delete` to inspect or remove draft files. Do not attach files to message templates unless the CLI schema explicitly exposes that path.
- `crm add-to-email` is only for adding existing NoxInfluencer CRM channels to an existing email task. Do not treat CRM as required when the user already has creator IDs or explicit email addresses.

## Affiliate Marketing

- Use `affiliation` for Shopify affiliate stores, campaigns, members, tracking links, discount codes, and performance reads. This is separate from normal `short-link`.
- Start with `affiliation stores list`. If no store is authorized or access is denied, ask the user to authorize/manage the store in SaaS; do not attempt store authorization in the Skill.
- Add NoxInfluencer creators to affiliate campaigns with search/profile `creator_id`, or use `platform + channel_id` / `custom_id` when the CLI schema calls for it.

## Deduplication and Collaborators

- Search result deduplication is a second step after `creator search`: run `creator search-filter-options`, then call `creator search-filter --body-file` with the current page `data.items[].id` values and the selected filter patch. It filters a returned page; it does not launch a fresh search.
- Email recipient deduplication is task-scoped: use `email recipients filter options` to find SaaS-aligned choices, `email recipients filter get <task_id>` to inspect saved state/counts, and `email recipients filter update <task_id> --body-file` to change it.
- Email collaborators use SaaS team `user_uid`. If the user does not know the ID, run `email collaborators list` without `task_id` first; with a `task_id`, it reads that task's current collaborator permissions. Use `add` or `remove` for incremental changes; use `replace` only when the user intends to reset the whole collaborator set.

## CRM Update Semantics

- `crm update` / `crm batch-update` may auto-create a NoxInfluencer CRM channel for valid platform `creator_id` tokens when updating cooperation status or labels. For label-only updates, the service uses the default cooperation status before applying labels.
- Use `crm labels create` when the user needs a new CRM tag ID. Use the returned `label_id` in `crm batch-update` with `labels.operation=add` or `remove`.
- Owner-only or archive-only updates do not auto-create CRM channels. Treat missing-channel failures as real failures, not successful skips.
- For batch previews and applies, report `existing_count`, `will_create_count`, and `created_count` when present; do not infer success only from requested IDs.

## Collection Add and Import

- Use `creator lookalikes` when the user asks for similar creators based on a source creator or URL. It is read-only and requires `target_platform`; save returned creator IDs with `collection add-creators` only after the user chooses targets.
- Use `collection add-creators` when the user wants to save creators returned by `creator search` or creator read commands into one or more collections. The JSON body uses `collection_ids`, `platform`, and `creator_ids`. Use `channel_ids` only when the user already has raw same-platform channel IDs. It is an add-only path, not forced collection-to-collection copy.
- Use `collection import-file <collection_id> --file <path>` for the user's owned creator links. The spreadsheet's first column should be the YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok creator URL; an optional second column may contain email/contact data. This import is accepted asynchronously, so poll `collection items <collection_id>` by platform to confirm resolved rows.
- Do not confuse these paths with collection copy/move. `add-creators` adds explicit creators to target collections; `import-file` imports owned creator URLs into one collection.

## Mutation Rules

- Write commands default to dry-run. Treat dry-run output as a preview, not completion.
- Use `--force` only after the user has approved the exact object and action.
- Feedback submission is also a write command, but it is free and does not consume Skill quota. Use it for product bugs, confusing behavior, data issues, suggestions, or feature requests. Attach screenshots/logs with `--file` when useful, and check `feedback inbox` for asynchronous follow-up.
- For staged workflows, always run `validate` before `preview`, and `preview` before `apply --force`.
- For `send` and `schedule`, confirm the task/thread, recipient scope, sender identity, scheduled time when relevant, and content approval before execution.
- Do not draft outreach or negotiation copy. If content is missing, ask the user for approved content or hand off to a writing task without invoking NoxInfluencer write commands.
- Do not operate external CRM, email, messaging, or spreadsheet platforms. These commands only affect NoxInfluencer-owned objects.

## JSON-First Commands

Many marketing-ops commands intentionally keep complex selectors in JSON bodies. When a schema requires `--body-file`:

1. Run `noxinfluencer schema <cmd>` to inspect required fields and usage notes.
2. Prepare the minimal JSON body needed for the user's request.
3. Prefer the CLI's validate/preview stages when available.
4. Preserve stable opaque IDs from responses (`campaign_id`, `collection_id`, `creator_id`, `thread_id`, `task_id`, `export_id`) for follow-up calls.

## Export Handling

- Export creation is async and usually returns `export_id`.
- Poll with `export get` or inspect with `export list`.
- Only run `export download <export_id> --output <path>` when the export is ready.
- Download writes binary data to the requested file path, not stdout. Report the output path and file metadata after completion.
