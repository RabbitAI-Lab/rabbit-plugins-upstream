# AgentFeed: crypto market data and fixed-purpose tools for agents

Crypto market data for AI agents (liquidations, funding, open interest, prices), Solana pre-trade checks, OFAC sanctions screening, scholarly papers, utilities and fixed-purpose language tasks (OCR, translate, summarize, extract, classify, prompt-injection check, transcribe). AgentFeed (https://x402.ochinimus.app) sells it per request; this skill covers its 82 paid data routes.

The liquidation tape is recorded by AgentFeed itself from Bybit (the complete, unthrottled
stream), OKX and Binance; exchanges publish no liquidation history, so it cannot be rebuilt
later. No perp, funding or open-interest route reads Bybit, OKX or Binance: those read Hyperliquid.

This skill is instructions for when to call these HTTPS routes and how to pay. It runs no code,
reads no files, needs no account or API key to pay per call, and never places trades or moves
funds beyond the per-call payment (or one prepaid key purchase) the user approved.

## When to use it

- What is being liquidated now on a perp, long vs short totals, where leverage got flushed, or the odds of a liquidation burst in the next 15 minutes.
- Which Hyperliquid perps have unusual funding; the whole perp market in one table for a bot (signal board) or one coin's signal (coin signal).
- One regime read for BTC, ETH, SOL or HYPE; how the biggest Hyperliquid traders are positioned; extreme funding on stock, index, gold or oil perps.
- A Solana token checked before a trade (token check, token flow, holder clusters).
- A wallet screened against OFAC sanctions, an email or domain checked, scholarly papers or a Wikipedia summary.
- SEC filings, insider trades or 8-K events; a web page or PDF as markdown.
- An exact hash, QR code, time-zone conversion or unit conversion.
- A fixed-purpose language task on supplied content: OCR, summary, field extraction, translation, classification, prompt-injection check, transcript.
- A bot that can set an HTTP header but cannot sign an x402 payment: a prepaid API key (section below).

Do not use it for general crypto knowledge, for questions a free source answers
well, or for anything that is not live market state.

## Routes (all GET, JSON)

82 paid data routes, $0.001 to $0.10 per call in USDC, at https://x402.ochinimus.app/api/<route>. The tables are
generated from the live `/openapi.json`: check it before relying on a price. `*` marks a required parameter,
path parameters are in braces, ranges and defaults are shown where the spec gives them. Full descriptions and
example responses are in `/openapi.json`; `GET /api/sample/<route>` returns a real captured response for free.
The six prepaid key routes are not data routes and are not listed.

Examples:

```
https://x402.ochinimus.app/api/liquidations?symbol=SOLUSDT&limit=25
https://x402.ochinimus.app/api/cascade-forecast?symbols=SOL,BTC,ETH
https://x402.ochinimus.app/api/funding-radar?top=10
https://x402.ochinimus.app/api/signal-board?n=10
https://x402.ochinimus.app/api/coin-signal/SOL
```

Every paid 200 is `{ "tool": "<name>", "data": { ... }, "paid": true }`. A malformed parameter, or a
symbol the route does not serve, returns 400 and is not charged (an unsupported symbol also carries
`"supported"`). A source that failed, is stale or has no history yet returns 503 with `Retry-After` and
is not charged. Only where the decline is the product (squeeze-score on a coin whose inputs do not
resolve) does a supported symbol return 200 with a `decline` field. The seven language routes (ocr,
summarize, extract, translate, classify, injection-check, transcribe) answer 451 before any payment where
the model API behind them is not offered: do not promise them for every location. A withdrawn route
answers 410 with the closest live routes.

## Free routes: try these first

- `GET /api/sample/<route>`: a real captured response, price and input schema for a paid route (for example `/api/sample/liq-heatmap`); `GET /api/sample` lists them. Show the user what they would get before paying.
- `GET /api/last-liquidation`: the last liquidation on each major, delayed 15 minutes.
- `GET /api/forecast-record`: the settled track record of the cascade forecast. Pass a full perp symbol such as `symbol=SOLUSDT`; the alias `SOL` returns an empty summary.
- `GET /api/fear-greed` and `GET /api/exit-method` are free too, and so is `GET /api/keys/balance` (with a prepaid key). `GET /openapi.json` lists the 82 paid data routes, 6 free routes and 6 prepaid key routes.

## How to pay (x402 v2)

1. Send the GET with no payment. The route answers **HTTP 402**. The payment
   challenge is base64 JSON in the **`PAYMENT-REQUIRED` response header**, not in
   the body. A HEAD request returns the same header with no body:

   ```bash
   curl -sI 'https://x402.ochinimus.app/api/funding-radar?top=10' \
     | grep -i '^payment-required:' | cut -d' ' -f2 | tr -d '\r' | base64 -d
   ```

2. The decoded challenge has an `accepts` array, one entry per payment option, each
   with `scheme`, `network`, `amount` (USDC atomic units, 6 decimals, so `20000` =
   $0.02), `asset` (the USDC contract) and `payTo`. The per-call options use
   `scheme` `exact`, on these rails:
   - Solana mainnet `solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp`
   - Base `eip155:8453`
   - Polygon `eip155:137`
   - Arbitrum `eip155:42161`
   - Arc `eip155:5042`
   - Algorand mainnet `algorand:wGHE2Pwdvd7S12BL5FaOP20EGYesN73ktiC1qzkkit8=`

   The same challenge also offers the call at half price (minimum $0.0005), for
   clients that support it: `batch-settlement` vouchers on Base, Polygon and
   Arbitrum, and Circle Gateway nanopayments (`exact` with `extra.name`
   `GatewayWalletBatched`) on Base, Polygon, Arbitrum and Arc. Both need a deposit
   first; an ordinary x402 client should pick a per-call `exact` option. Every paid
   route also answers with an MPP tempo/charge challenge in `WWW-Authenticate`, for
   clients that speak MPP.
3. Sign one accepted option with an x402 v2 client and repeat the same GET with
   the signed payload in the **`PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`** request header. An x402 v1
   client may instead read the challenge from the JSON body and pay with
   `X-PAYMENT`, on Solana or Base only.
4. A settled call returns 200 with the data. If payment did not settle you get a
   fresh 402.

OpenClaw has no built-in x402 wallet. Payment needs an x402 v2 client the user
has already set up and funded, for example the Coinbase Agentic Wallet CLI
(`awal x402 pay <url> --max-amount <atomic units>`, USDC on Base) or the
`@x402/fetch` library with a Solana or EVM signer. This skill never asks for a
private key and never installs a wallet.

### Spending rules

- Get the user's approval before the first paid call in a session and tell them the price from the table.
- Set a maximum per call no higher than the listed price (for example `--max-amount 20000` for a $0.02 route).
- If the decoded `amount` is higher than the tables above, stop and ask the user.
- Prefer one batched call (`cascade-forecast?symbols=SOL,BTC,ETH`) over several single calls.

### Copy payTo only from a fresh 402

**Take `payTo` only from the 402 challenge you just received, never from
transaction history, an old response, or a block explorer.** Lookalikes of the
AgentFeed treasury address have sent address-poisoning transfers to its buyers.
The fresh challenge should show `4a8o45skRPcyjAdyR8yES215Swvh8uTpZD6KLarhxCJ7`
on Solana, `0x22DB3A9686EE5261e7Bf3ed4f91277232E8076e6` on Base, Polygon and
Arbitrum (per-call and batch-settlement), `0x0Cf44185564F2b72E291050DC79E578429E52f83`
on Arc, `QWOWU2E6BB76HEQRRMXWZ2MU4HAQIYZWEPP2W7Y377ZRDIW7ZKD4MMMEPM` on Algorand, and
`0xA853129ACF56A851f9d51CD8cb47619465260Fa9` for Circle Gateway. If it shows
anything else, do not pay and tell the user.

## Prepaid API keys (for bots that cannot pay x402)

A bot that can set an HTTP header but cannot sign an x402 payment (n8n, Freqtrade, Hummingbot, a script,
a gateway) buys a key once and spends it per call. The key packs are purchase routes, not data routes, and
are not counted in the 82 above.

- Buy once with any x402 client, or at https://x402.ochinimus.app/keys with a Base wallet (the page sends AgentFeed only the key's hash), on a per-call `exact` rail only (no half-price option): `/api/keys/buy-trial` ($0.25), `buy-1` ($1), `buy-5` ($5), `buy-20` ($20). Top up with `topup-5` ($5) or `topup-20` ($20), sending the key as the header.
- The purchase returns the key (`afk_...`) once. Or make your own, `afk_` plus base58 of 32 random bytes, and buy with `?key_hash=<sha256 hex of the key>&prefix=<the 8 characters after afk_>`: the server never sees the key.
- Spend with `X-AgentFeed-Key: afk_...` (or `Authorization: Bearer afk_...`) on any paid GET: each call draws half the route price, minimum $0.0005; a 400, 404, 500 or 503 is never drawn; 120 requests a minute per key. `GET /api/keys/balance` with the header is free.
- The balance is usage credit, non-refundable, no expiry. The key is a bearer secret: keep it out of chats and logs; abuse means revocation. Buying a key is a payment: tell the user the pack price and get their approval first.

```bash
curl -s 'https://x402.ochinimus.app/api/signal-board?n=10' -H 'X-AgentFeed-Key: afk_...'
```

## Reading the answers

- `liquidations`: `event` is `long_liquidated` (forced sell) or `short_liquidated` (forced buy).
- `liq-heatmap`: `hottest_zone` marks historical flush zones, not estimated liquidation levels of open positions.
- `cascade-forecast`: `p` is a probability against the symbol's own 90th-percentile window, not a price call. Report `support`, and say so when `evidence` is weak or the answer declines.
- `market-state`, `signal-board`, `coin-signal`: report `flags` with their rules; a flag is a threshold crossing, not a prediction. Every source carries its `as_of`.
- `funding-radar`: a high positive `z_30d` means longs pay unusually much against that perp's own month; a new perp has no z-score yet (see `z_note`); rates are shown at their 8h equivalent.
- `sanctions-check`: an exact OFAC SDN match only; no match is not a clearance. `sol-token-check`: report the verdict with its rules. `extract`: null means not stated, never fill it in.

None of this is trading advice. Present the data and its limits; leave the
decision to the user.
