# Vox

Use the installed `vox` CLI instead of the web UI.

## Keep authorization explicit

- Act only on one URL written by the current user or one exact local file path the current user identified.
- Never browse a directory, inspect nearby files, read the clipboard, infer an attachment, expand a glob, consume stdin, or assemble a batch to choose an input.
- Treat install, login, logout, configuration changes, file reads, and output writes as separate actions that require the current request to authorize them.
- Keep `vox auth status` and `vox skill status` read-only. Troubleshooting permits read-only diagnosis only.

## Check the CLI

Prefer the installed `vox` command. Check it with:

```bash
command -v vox
vox --version
vox --help
```

Require CLI `0.1.0` or newer and explicit `auth`, `transcribe`, and `skill` commands. If it is missing or too old, ask before installing or upgrading:

```bash
npm install -g @casatwy/vox@^0.1.0
```

Do not fall back to another product's CLI, environment variables, or configuration.

## Authenticate safely

Run `vox auth status` before asking for credentials. If login is needed, direct the user to create a key at `https://vox.reka.cc/me/api-keys`, then run:

```bash
vox auth login
```

Let the CLI read the key through its hidden interactive prompt. Never put a key in command arguments, a copied command, chat output, a log, or a file created by the agent. Automation may use an already-provided `VOX_API_KEY` environment variable, but never print it.

Use the production default for normal work. Do not pass `--base-url` or set `VOX_BASE_URL` unless the current user explicitly requests a different Vox endpoint.

## Transcribe exactly one input

For a URL, pass the exact submitted URL unchanged and let Vox identify whether the backend can transcribe it:

```bash
vox transcribe '<url>'
```

For one exact ordinary local audio/video file, use:

```bash
vox transcribe --file '<path>'
```

Add `--mime-type '<type>'` only when the current user supplies the type or automatic detection fails and the user confirms the correction.

- Do not maintain, enumerate, or infer a source allowlist.
- Do not rewrite the URL into another source or search for a replacement.
- Reject directories, globs, stdin, special files, multiple inputs, batches, and resumable-upload expectations.
- Do not retry unsupported collections, non-transcribable posts, paid-only content, or other HTTP 422 audit results.

## Preserve user choices

- Omit `--language` unless the current user explicitly selects a transcription language. Do not infer it from the conversation, locale, title, or media.
- Add `--format '<format>'` only for an explicitly requested format.
- Add `--output '<path>'` only when the user explicitly requests a destination. Never authorize overwrite; preserve the CLI's no-clobber result.
- Keep transcript/result bytes on stdout or in the requested output file. Summarize progress from stderr without pasting raw diagnostic or JSONL events.
- Use text progress for people and JSONL only when a calling workflow explicitly needs machine-readable progress.

## Handle results and failures

- Preserve SRT, VTT, JSON, JSONL, and explicitly requested raw text exactly. Do not clean, translate, summarize, or reformat them.
- Report when the service returns subtitles directly instead of creating a paid transcription.
- Treat authentication failures, insufficient balance, and HTTP 422 responses as terminal. Do not retry them.
- Allow the CLI to perform its bounded retry and SSE-to-polling recovery. Never create a second task merely because live events stop.
- On `SIGINT`, say only that local waiting stopped. Do not claim the server task was cancelled.
- Never expose API keys, cookies, signed URLs, secret query parameters, private API payloads, or another product's configuration while diagnosing a failure.

## Manage the Skill

Only on an explicit install request, use one platform value:

```bash
vox skill install --platform codex
vox skill install --platform claude
vox skill install --platform gemini
vox skill install --platform openclaw
```

Use `vox skill status` for read-only discovery. Add `--platform codex|claude|gemini|openclaw` only when the user names one platform. Refuse to replace an existing same-name installation from a different source; surface the conflict and stop.
