### License/Terms of Use: <br>
MIT-0 <br>


## Use Case: <br>
Developers and agents use this skill to prepare and submit PoYo Wan 2.7 image generation or editing requests, then track async task status through polling or webhooks. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: PoYo API keys could be exposed if placed in browser code, public repositories, logs, screenshots, or chat output. <br>
Mitigation: Keep POYO_API_KEY in a server-side environment variable or backend secret manager and avoid echoing it in generated commands or responses. <br>
Risk: Prompts, referenced image URLs, callback URLs, and API-authenticated requests are sent to PoYo. <br>
Mitigation: Use this skill only when PoYo is approved for the data involved, and avoid confidential prompts, source images, or callback URLs unless the user has accepted that provider risk. <br>
Risk: Submitting a prepared payload makes a live external API request. <br>
Mitigation: Run submission commands only from a trusted shell after the user explicitly asks for live execution and has provided a safe server-side environment. <br>
