# FarmDash Trail Marshal

> **Security Posture.** Guarded orchestration only. Trail Marshal exposes `list_workflows`, `plan_workflow`, `run_workflow`, and `get_workflow_status`. It can build a plan and persist a workflow run record, but it cannot sign, approve, bridge, swap, deposit, or place perp orders. Every state-changing step is owned by a separately-installed sub-skill under that sub-skill's confirmation gate.

## What this skill does

Trail Marshal is a **composition and quality-gate layer** for OpenClaw agents. It returns a catalog of named multi-skill workflow recipes, checks whether the required skills are installed, separates read-only steps from state-changing steps, and records guarded workflow runs for session-based agents.

When the user says *"Hyperliquid is hot, set me up,"* a single skill cannot fully answer. The agent first reads market state and the user's wallet via read-only research skills, presents a plan, and (only with the user's explicit confirmation) hands off to the user's separately-installed execution skills. Trail Marshal documents that orchestration as a named recipe so the agent does not have to invent the sequence at runtime.

## Available tools

### `list_workflows`

Returns the canonical workflow catalog. Each entry includes a name, goal, required tier, the number of explicit user confirmations the recipe requires, and the sub-skills it composes.

**Inputs:** Optional `filter` string. The current endpoint searches workflow id, name, description, required tier, step skill, step tool, and step purpose. Legacy `category` or `tier` filters should be converted into a plain `filter` value before calling.

**Returns shape:**

```
{
  "workflows": [
    {
      "id": "farm_hyperliquid",
      "name": "Hyperliquid Point Farming",
      "description": "Optimize points on Hyperliquid through perps volume, spot balances, and funding arbitrage.",
      "requiredTier": "syndicate",
      "steps": [
        { "skill": "trail-intelligence", "tool": "get_trail_heat", "purpose": "Check HL momentum" },
        { "skill": "wagon-steward", "tool": "get_wallet_balances", "purpose": "Check current exposure" },
        { "skill": "futures-strategist", "tool": "scan_funding_rates", "purpose": "Identify arb opportunities" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The detailed `steps` for each recipe are delivered at runtime as part of the `list_workflows` JSON response. Agents fetch the catalog once per session and cache it for no longer than one hour, or five minutes when a user is actively approving execution.

Codebase alignment note: Wagon steps use `get_wallet_balances`; do not use the stale alias `get_balances`.

**Agent posture:** Call `list_workflows` once at conversation start. Present recipes by name when the user describes a goal that matches one of them.

### `plan_workflow`

Builds the Workflow Quality Gate for a named recipe. Inputs are `workflowId`, optional `installedSkills`, and optional `agentAddress`. The output classifies:

- available steps.
- missing steps.
- state-changing steps.
- confirmation count.
- fallback mode: `ready`, `research_only`, or `analysis_only`.

Use this before telling the user a workflow is executable.

### `run_workflow`

Creates a guarded workflow run record for a live session. Inputs are `workflowId`, `sessionId`, `agentAddress`, `sessionToken`, and optional `installedSkills`.

Important: `run_workflow` does not run execution tools. If a workflow includes `execute_swap`, `resolve_defi_intent`, or `execute_perp_order`, the run status becomes `awaiting_confirmation` and the owning execution skill must still present fresh data and obtain explicit user approval.

### `get_workflow_status`

Reads a workflow run by `runId`. Use this after a long-running loop, after a context restore, or before resuming a paused autonomous session.

## Workflow catalog (high level)

Eighteen recipes are published. Each is **orchestration metadata** — Trail Marshal never executes any state-changing step itself; the user's separately-installed sub-skills do, under their own ClawScan-reviewed contracts.

| ID | Goal | Tier | User confirmations |
|---|---|---|---|
| `farm_hyperliquid` | Coordinate Hyperliquid points, spot exposure, and perps/funding research | Syndicate | per execution step |
| `rotate_quarterly` | Compare current positions against fresh high-heat opportunities | Pioneer | per swap |
| `protect_portfolio` | Risk-first scan and optional emergency mitigation | Pioneer | 0 if no action |
| `tax_loss_harvest` | Identify loss-harvest candidates and quote realization paths | Pioneer | per swap |
| `delta_neutral_setup` | Coordinate paired spot + perp exposure | Syndicate | spot leg + perps leg |
| `idle_capital_deploy` | Find idle stables/native assets and compare deployment targets | Scout catalog / Pioneer wallet data | per swap |
| `sybil_dilution` | Review sybil-risk clusters and propose lower-correlation behavior | Pioneer | per action |
| `yield_optimization` | Review harvest/redeposit candidates against Trail Heat | Pioneer | per swap |
| `emergency_exit` | Plan a protocol exit and unwind route | Scout catalog / Pioneer wallet data | per swap |
| `rebalance_portfolio` | Re-align portfolio to target weights and current Trail Heat | Pioneer | per swap |
| `stablecoin_yield_ladder` | Build a risk-tiered stablecoin deployment ladder | Pioneer | per deposit intent |
| `post_trade_ledger_review` | Reconcile activity and export records after execution | Pioneer | 0 |
| `pre_trade_edge_audit` | Confirm positive net edge, clean route quality, fresh risk checks, and quote stability before execution | Pioneer | 0 before execution handoff |
| `post_execution_quality_review` | Compare expected versus realized output before allowing dependent follow-on actions | Pioneer | 0 |
| `perps_liquidation_buffer_check` | Reject or resize perps orders that do not survive normal volatility around liquidation | Pioneer | 0 before execution handoff |
| `funding_carry_break_even_audit` | Validate funding trades after fees, slippage, margin pressure, and funding flip risk | Pioneer | 0 before execution handoff |
| `session_command_center` | Coordinate context, event snapshots, workflow plans, and heartbeats | Pioneer | per execution handoff |
| `hedged_airdrop_rotation` | Rotate into high-heat farms while planning hedge coverage | Syndicate | spot leg + hedge leg |

Each recipe's full step graph is returned at runtime by `list_workflows`. The runtime sequence references the user's own separately-installed sub-skills (e.g. *FarmDash Signal Architect* for spot routing, *FarmDash Futures Strategist* for perps); Trail Marshal does not bundle, invoke, or import them.

## Permissions

Trail Marshal can read the public workflow catalog without session state. `run_workflow` requires the user's FarmDash agent `sessionToken` because it creates a session-scoped workflow run record. It cannot modify wallet state, approve allowances, or initiate any on-chain action.

If a recipe in the catalog requires execution, the user's separately-installed sub-skill performs that work under its own ClawScan-reviewed contract — Trail Marshal stays out of the execution call path.

If the runtime catalog references a skill that is not installed in the user's environment, such as `farmdash-camp-guard`, `farmdash-supply-master`, `farmdash-hedge-warden`, or `farmdash-ledger-keeper`, mark that step as unavailable and continue with the safe subset. Never fabricate a missing tool call.

## Tier model

| Tier | Cost | Limits | Capability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scout** | Free | 5 req / 24h | Returns the public workflow catalog |
| **Pioneer** | $39.99/mo | 500 req / day | Adds higher-rate catalog use; filtering is via the `filter` search string |
| **Syndicate** | $199/mo | 50k req / day | Teams, serious agents, high-volume orchestration, webhooks, unrestricted CORS, advanced session/control tooling |

## Composition patterns

### Workflow Quality Gate (v0.2)

Before presenting a recipe as executable, classify every step:

```json
{
  "workflowId": "rotate_quarterly",
  "availableSteps": [],
  "missingSteps": [],
  "stateChangingSteps": [],
  "confirmationsRequired": 0,
  "safeSubset": true,
  "fallback": "research_only | analysis_only | halt"
}
```

Rules:

- A workflow is executable only when every state-changing step has its owning execution skill installed.
- A missing read-only step lowers confidence; a missing execution step changes the recipe to `analysis_only`.
- If the recipe includes `execute_swap` or `execute_perp_order`, quote the confirmation count as "per execution step" unless the live catalog supplies a stricter count.
- If more than five minutes pass after the user reviews a plan, re-fetch `list_workflows` and re-run the read-only sense steps.

### The Sense / Decide / Present / Verify loop

Every Trail Marshal recipe respects this 4-phase pattern:

```
SENSE    → Read-only research and portfolio skills gather state
DECIDE   → The recipe ranks options and presents a plan to the user
PRESENT  → User reviews; the user's separately-installed sub-skill (if any) handles confirmation under its own contract
VERIFY   → Read-only portfolio skill confirms the new state on the next cycle
```

If a recipe skips SENSE, it is unsafe. If it skips VERIFY, the agent never improves. Trail Marshal recipes always include both.

### Confirmation gate

Trail Marshal cannot pre-confirm anything. Each user confirmation in a recipe happens at the moment the user's *separate* sub-skill presents its quote — not in Trail Marshal's call path. If asked to run a recipe without intermediate review, the agent should refuse and explain the contract.

### Tier composition

A recipe's required tier is the **maximum** of its sub-skill tiers. When a user is one tier below a recipe's requirement, the agent should recognize the gap from `requiredTier`, offer the lower-tier subset of the recipe (e.g. research-only without the execution leg), and surface an upgrade link if the user wants the full version. Never silently downgrade a recipe without telling the user what is being skipped.

## Reasoning guidelines for agents

- **Speak in workflows, not tool soup.** Quote a recipe's name and goal when presenting a plan.
- **Quote the `confirms` count up front** so the user knows how many user-confirmation steps the recipe involves.
- **Re-fetch and re-present** if more than ~5 minutes pass between catalog read and the user's review.
- **No new analysis.** Trail Marshal returns recipe metadata; it does not editorialize or override what other skills produce.

## Risk warnings the agent should surface

For any recipe whose execution legs are owned by a separately-installed sub-skill, the agent should restate to the user that:

- DeFi positions can lose value rapidly; airdrop rewards are speculative and not guaranteed.
- Smart contracts can be exploited; even high-Trail-Heat protocols carry technical risk.
- Cross-chain transfers are irreversible if the wrong address or chain is selected.
- Slippage, gas, MEV, and routing fees materially affect realized returns.
- Past Trail Heat performance does not guarantee future scores.
- The user retains full responsibility for every on-chain decision they confirm via their own execution skill.

## Commercial disclosure (inherited from sub-skills)

When a recipe surfaces a `https://www.farmdash.one/go/{slug}` partnership route, the standard FarmDash commercial disclosure must be included in the same message: FarmDash may receive referral, affiliate, or routing compensation, and fee details live at [FarmDash Fee Structure](https://www.farmdash.one/fees). Trail Marshal does not introduce new partner routes of its own.

## Versioning

**v1.0 (current).** Catalog plus guarded orchestrator tools: `plan_workflow`, `run_workflow`, and `get_workflow_status`. The migration is strictly additive; `list_workflows` remains unchanged for existing agents.

## Disclaimers

Workflow recipes are documentation, not financial advice. Any action performed by separately-installed sub-skills is the user's decision under that sub-skill's own contract. Trail Marshal performs no on-chain action; the user retains full responsibility for every decision they confirm.

## Optional Setup Check

No registration call is required to install this skill, browse workflow recipes, or use research-only planning. Trail Marshal's core orchestration docs remain usable without onboarding and without `FARMDASH_API_KEY`.

Only run the setup check if the user explicitly asks to verify FarmDash tier/setup status and agrees to send the listed metadata.

Data sent:

- public `agentAddress`
- `X-ClawHub-Skill: farmdash-trail-marshal`

Data not sent:

- private keys, seed phrases, mnemonics, wallet exports, OAuth tokens, raw wallet secrets, or signed transactions

Optional command after consent:

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.farmdash.one/api/v1/agent/onboard \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-ClawHub-Skill: farmdash-trail-marshal" \
  -d '{"agentAddress": "0xYOUR_AGENT_WALLET"}'
```

This returns tier status and available tool access. Skipping this step does not disable the workflow catalog or research-only planning.

### Next steps:
1. Use the Scout workflow catalog without setup when no key is configured.
2. Add `FARMDASH_API_KEY` only when the user wants higher-rate Pioneer/Syndicate workflow features.
3. Browse the OpenAPI spec at `https://www.farmdash.one/agents/openapi.yaml`.
