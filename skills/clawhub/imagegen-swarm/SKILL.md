# imagegen-swarm

Use this when the user asks to generate an image, draw, edit an image, use reference images, make a video, or do text-to-image or text-to-video, including Codex, Grok, Grok Imagine, Gemini, nano banana, Antigravity, Jimeng, Dreamina, Muse, and Lovart. Do not use it for ordinary local image processing such as crop, resize, or convert.

The core is work-stealing: write the images you need as a job list and hand it to `batch.mjs`. All six engines start at once with a few lanes each, and whichever lane is free takes the next image it can handle, so every engine's quota is used and the batch finishes as fast as possible. A single image goes through `batch.mjs` too: the first engine in line takes it, and if that engine is out of quota the next one does.

```bash
node scripts/batch.mjs --jobs jobs.json --out out/
```

`jobs.json` is an array of `{"id": "cat", "prompt": "...", "aspect": "1:1", "ref": ["a.png"], "video": false, "engine": "gemini"}`; only `id` and `prompt` are required. `ref` paths are relative to the job file, and `engine` pins a job to one engine. Output goes to `out/<id>.png` (`.mp4` for video); existing files are skipped, so an interrupted run resumes where it stopped.

- Lanes scale with your RAM. The baseline is 8 GB (measured on an M1: 12 images at once with no slowdown and about 30% memory left): gemini and codex 6 each, jimeng and grok 4, lovart 2. Other machines scale proportionally, at least 1 and at most 1.5× per engine (4 GB → 12 lanes in total, 16 GB or more → 34); muse always gets 1. Lanes take work in that order and the first log line shows the counts. Set `IMAGE_GEN_MEMORY_GB=4` (for example) to size lanes for a smaller memory budget. `--engines` limits the engines; `--lanes gemini=3,muse=0` overrides lane counts.
- Tail stealing: once the queue is empty, an idle lane may duplicate an image that is still running. It does that only after the holder has run longer than 1.5× its own median time for this batch (the built-in typical time until this batch has samples). A fast engine does not redo an image a slower engine just started. At most one duplicate runs. Whichever finishes first is kept; the other is cancelled (SIGINT to the process group, or a cancel file for Muse) or ignored if it finishes later. `batch-results.json` lists every attempt with start, finish and outcome (done, cancelled, failed).
- An engine that reports exhausted quota, no login or no install is shut down immediately, and the image it held goes back to the queue. A plain rate limit (HTTP 429, `rate limit`, or `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` without an explicit quota or credit failure) backs off and is shut down only after three consecutive rate-limit failures. A missing reference or output file, or any other generic "not found", does not shut the engine down.
- If a job sets an aspect ratio, an image whose ratio is off by more than 3% is discarded and redone by another engine.
- A failed image (refusal, timeout, …) is retried on an engine that has not tried it yet, up to `--tries` engines (default 3). An image no engine can take counts as failed.
- Every start, finish, retry and shutdown prints one JSON line; the last line is the summary, and `out/batch-results.json` records which engine made each image and how long it took. Exit code is non-zero if anything failed.
- When the user names an engine, run only that one with `--engines`.
- To pause an engine, create `~/.config/imagegen-swarm/engine-off/<engine>` (or set `IMAGE_GEN_ENGINE_OFF` to another folder); batch, check and evals skip it. Delete the file to turn it back on. A switch left in `~/.config/image-gen/engine-off/` still counts.

## Engines

| Engine | Script | Can do | Aspect ratio | Time per image | Quota |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| codex | `codex-image.mjs` | image, reference images | `--aspect`, chosen by the model | ~30 s | Codex plan usage |
| jimeng | `jimeng-image.mjs` | image, edit (≤10 references), text-to-video, image-to-video | `--aspect`, real parameter | 30–50 s | Dreamina credits (~3 per image) |
| grok | `grok-image.mjs` | image, edit, reference-to-video | `--ratio`, real parameter | ~45 s | X / Grok plan usage |
| gemini | `gemini-image.mjs` | image, edit (≤3 references) | `--aspect`, real parameter | 20–45 s | Antigravity (Gemini) quota |
| muse | `muse-image.py` | image, reference images | `--aspect`, written into the task | 1–2 min | Muse weekly limit |
| lovart | `lovart.mjs` | image, reference images | `--aspect`, written into the prompt | ~35 s | Lovart credits |

Each engine script also works on its own (run `.mjs` with node, `.py` with python3). Shared flags: `--prompt` or `--prompt-file`, `--out <png>`, repeatable `--ref`, `--timeout`; one image per call, one JSON line, non-zero exit on failure. `batch.mjs` builds these flags from each job: an aspect ratio only goes to engines that truly support it (jimeng eight ratios, gemini and muse seven, grok five), jobs with too many references skip engines with a lower limit (jimeng 10, gemini 3, grok 1), and video only goes to jimeng and grok (only jimeng does video without a reference).

## Engine notes

- **codex**: calls Codex's built-in `image_gen`. Always uses the official OpenAI provider (`-c model_provider="openai"`; `--model` defaults to `gpt-6-luna`, `--effort` to `low`), so it still works when the local Codex config points at a custom gateway. Runs in the `workspace-write` sandbox; use `--escalate-sandbox` only with the user's consent. It snapshots `~/.codex/generated_images` first and rejects any output identical to an older file. See [references/codex.md](references/codex.md).
- **grok**: read `~/.grok/bundled/skills/imagine/SKILL.md` first. No `--ref` → text to image; `--ref` → edit (keeps the source aspect ratio); `--video --ref` → 6 s 720p video (`--out` must be .mp4, `--ratio` cannot be auto). Video needs Grok data sharing set to Opt in; on a "zero data retention" error, tell the user rather than changing the setting.
- **jimeng**: uses the official Dreamina CLI (`dreamina`). No `--ref` → text to image (2K); `--ref` → edit; `--video` → text-to-video without references, or image-to-video from the first reference (default seedance2.0fast, 720p, 5 s; change with `--model`). Submit, polling and download go through `jimeng.mjs` in the same folder, which can also run any Dreamina generator directly. If a model returns `AigcComplianceConfirmationRequired`, the user must authorize it once on the Dreamina website.
- **gemini**: uses the Antigravity CLI's (`agy`) built-in `generate_image`, called by its image-generator subagent. `--aspect` accepts 1:1, 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 9:16, 16:9. Output includes `tool_prompt` and `prompt_verbatim`; `false` means the subagent rewrote the prompt, so mention it when delivering. A long prompt clipped in the session log does not discard an image that was generated; the script reads `transcript_full.jsonl` when Antigravity wrote one.
- **muse**: Muse has no API, so the script drives its own headless browser (profile `~/.config/imagegen-swarm/muse-browser`, override with `IMAGE_GEN_MUSE_PROFILE`) in one pass: open a side chat, send the task, wait, download from the cloud computer's file library, delete the side chat. Renaming the side chat is best-effort: if the rename dialog fails or times out, the script closes it and keeps generating. If Muse asks for approval, the script answers immediately: it clicks "Allow once" only when every request refers to this run's save folder `/home/hatch/workspace/imagegen-swarm`, and otherwise fails with the request text. One process at a time can use the browser. An existing profile in `~/.config/image-gen/muse-browser` is still used until you move it.
- **lovart**: opens a fresh thread every call (concurrent jobs on one thread return 409). A passing `query-mode` does not prove there are credits. Default model `generate_image_nano_banana_pro`; change it with `--model`. See [references/lovart.md](references/lovart.md).

Every engine checks that the returned image is new from this run and differs from the reference images after decoding, and converts non-PNG output to PNG.

## When every engine is out of quota

Generate in the ChatGPT, Gemini or Grok web app in a new browser tab, download and check the image, then close the tab. An engine error is different from running out of quota; if the engine the user named fails, report it instead of switching to the web.

## Checks

- `node scripts/check.mjs`: login status of all six engines (Dreamina also shows remaining credits).
- Look at every image before delivering it; sample frames from videos.
- After changing the skill, run the fixed tests: `node evals/run.mjs <outdir> [--only id,id]`. The script checks status, aspect ratio, prompt passthrough and Muse cleanup; a judge scores each image 1–5 using the rubric in `evals/evals.json`. The change is done when every check passes and every image scores at least 4.
