### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Developers and operations engineers use this skill to triage Linux disk usage alerts, identify safe cleanup candidates, and compare low-risk data migration against higher-risk partition expansion plans.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: The skill includes destructive disk cleanup commands and system configuration edits.

Mitigation: Review exact command targets, confirm backups, and approve each deletion, partition change, Docker prune, and /etc write before execution.

Risk: Partition expansion and data migration guidance can cause data loss if applied to the wrong layout.

Mitigation: Verify df, lsblk, filesystem type, partition order, and backup status before following any expansion plan.
