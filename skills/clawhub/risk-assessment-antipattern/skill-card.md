### License/Terms of Use:

Apache-2.0

## Use Case:

External users, analysts, auditors, project teams, and content reviewers use this skill before investing in, assessing, or explaining an RWA/Web3 project to identify structural risks, weak asset self-liquidation, missing SPV isolation, oracle responsibility gaps, and high-risk liquidity promises. It is educational risk-screening support and does not provide legal, financial, or investment advice.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Users may treat the skill's RWA/Web3 screening output as legal, financial, or investment advice.

Mitigation: Present outputs as educational risk-screening support and direct users to qualified legal, financial, or compliance professionals before acting.

Risk: The skill includes China-specific compliance framing that may not map cleanly to other jurisdictions or future regulations.

Mitigation: Ask for the relevant jurisdiction, flag cross-border assumptions, and verify conclusions against current official regulatory guidance.

Risk: Project claims such as high stable returns, T+0 liquidity, or 'on-chain means safe' can mislead users into underestimating asset and responsibility-chain risks.

Mitigation: Require explicit checks for asset self-liquidation, ownership clarity, SPV bankruptcy isolation, oracle design, contract audit status, and written responsibility boundaries before giving a risk conclusion.
