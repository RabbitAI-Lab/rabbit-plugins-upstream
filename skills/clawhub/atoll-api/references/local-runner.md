# Local runner

Read this reference before installing, diagnosing, configuring, or operating `atoll-runner`, its repository bindings, loopback UI, leases, or recovery behavior.

### Local runner presence

Authenticated agents can register and refresh one local runner installation with
`PUT /api/orgs/{id}/runners/self`, read it with `GET`, and disconnect it with
`DELETE`. The organization and agent member are derived from authentication, not
the request body. The strict body contains `instanceId`, optional `hostId`, `platform`, `arch`,
`capabilities`, `clientVersion`. Intake state is server-owned and is not accepted
from self refresh; human pause/resume uses the hosted fleet control endpoint.
Platform, architecture,
and capabilities use closed documented values; the server derives the display name.
Recent competing installations return `409`; an installation silent for 10
minutes can be replaced. Refresh is limited to 60 requests per agent per
minute. Responses expose only bounded operational metadata and computed
`presence_state` (`connected`, `stale`, or `offline`), never keys, prompts, or
local filesystem paths.

### Local runner leases

`POST /api/orgs/{id}/runner-leases/claim` atomically claims one assigned,
accessible, dependency-satisfied issue for the authenticated agent's current
runner. The body accepts `issueId` and `idempotencyKey`; `attention_resume`
first claims require an unread `attentionItemId`, `runnerHostId` (maximum 255 characters), `preservedThreadId`,
and `actionKind`. The response returns an ephemeral token; only its SHA-256
hash is stored. An untouched, unexpired, pre-intent `active` replay returns a
new token with `token_reissued: true` and invalidates the original token. During
overlapping recovery retries, the four newest prior recovery tokens remain valid for one minute or
until one is used, which promotes it. Other replays return `token: null`; terminal attention replays are acknowledgement-only, including after notification acknowledgement.
Only a proven pre-intent orphan can be replaced. Lease rows enforce the composite `(issue_id, org_id)` tenant fence. `PATCH /api/orgs/{id}/runner-leases/{leaseId}` accepts fenced
renew, progress, turn-milestone, terminal, reconciliation, and acknowledgement
transitions, including `model_completed`. Exact mutation retries are idempotent, and `uncertain_outcome`
blocks automatic replacement. Disconnected, stale, or replaced runners cannot
mutate or replay. A paused current runner may mutate or reconcile an already-held
lease but cannot acquire a new claim. These routes do not create candidates, schedules,
arbitrary commands, automation events, or action history.
Optional `progress` and `errorCode` metadata uses documented closed operational
codes; free-form values and sensitive runtime details are rejected.

## CLI runner

Builds that include the real headless runner provide a separate `atoll-runner`
binary. It uses an existing named Atoll profile. The server controls identity,
intake, assignment, repository authorization, and lease eligibility.

```bash
atoll-runner --profile agent-a doctor
atoll-runner --profile agent-a repositories list
atoll-runner --profile agent-a repositories bind repo-ref /path/to/checkout --issue issue-uuid
atoll-runner --profile agent-a repositories validate repo-ref
atoll-runner --profile agent-a status
atoll-runner --profile agent-a run --once --dry-run
atoll-runner --profile agent-a run
atoll-runner --profile agent-a run --ui
atoll-runner --profile agent-a ui
```

`run` uses the pinned Codex SDK and runtime `0.153.4`. Codex must be
authenticated. Each issue requires exactly one verified repository on its
project and a matching machine-local `repo_ref` binding. A local binding does
not grant server access. The runner checks the origin identity and exact base
commit, then creates an owned branch and worktree without changing the primary
checkout. Codex uses `workspace-write`, approval policy `never`, and disabled
sandbox network access. It does not use a global Codex executable as a fallback.

`--dry-run` performs a read-only dispatch check. Manage pause/resume in hosted
Atoll under Workspace Settings → Runners. Local intake is read-only; legacy
`pause` and `resume` commands return `RUNNER_INTAKE_HOSTED_ONLY`. Pausing new
intake does not cancel a held lease. The runner keeps local thread/worktree evidence
and never submits a replacement turn after an uncertain post-intent outcome.
An attention resume requires the exact retained thread and validated ownership;
there is no fallback to a new thread. Terminal branches and worktrees remain
available for inspection and are not deleted automatically.

Use `atoll-runner --profile agent-a repositories remove repo-ref` to remove an
unused local binding. This does not remove the server repository mapping or
local Git checkout.

`run --ui` enables the optional setup and diagnostics page at
`http://127.0.0.1:4735`; `--ui-port` selects another local port. `ui --port 4735`
opens diagnostics without starting work, including for a stopped runner or
malformed local config. Select the existing credential profile with `--profile`
at process start. Credentials never enter browser forms or responses.
The page lists server-authorized repositories, local bindings, Codex health,
local jobs/worktrees, uncertainty, and bounded redacted logs. Bindings use the
same runner config writer and never grant server authorization. Bind/remove
are blocked while a current job exists. Refresh, config validation, and Codex
preflight are non-destructive; there is no model retry or cleanup button.
A UI port or asset failure does not stop headless execution. Do not proxy this
loopback interface to another host. Service installation remains separate.

### macOS service and lifecycle

Install an explicit user service only when unattended operation is required:

```bash
atoll-runner --profile agent-a service install
atoll-runner --profile agent-a service install --ui --ui-port 4735
atoll-runner --profile agent-a service status
atoll-runner --profile agent-a service uninstall
```

The service is macOS-only. Install writes an atomic user-owned `0600` plist
under `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` with canonical Node and runner entry paths,
the selected profile, `run`, and optional loopback UI arguments. It contains no
environment variables, API keys, Codex or lease tokens, shell command,
checkout path, or worktree path. Unknown or changed plists fail closed.
Package installation is passive and never installs or starts the service. Use
uninstall, package upgrade, `doctor`, then install for an upgrade. Uninstall
removes only the exact owned plist and leaves journals, tokens, logs, branches,
and worktrees. Status and uninstall validate the local plist and do not require
profile credentials; install remains authenticated.

SIGINT/SIGTERM closes the process-local intake gate immediately. The current
child drains for at most 30 seconds; TERM and then KILL after 10 seconds are
sent only when the journaled PID still has the same process-start identity. A
wall-clock event-loop gap above 30 seconds is a possible wake. The child is
stopped, durable lease state is reconciled, and intake reopens only after that
pass. A wake may release a worker only to finish an already durable result;
stop never releases a worker. No hosted pause request is sent. Existing-wire
response failures are bounded as `RUNNER_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH` and keep pending
mutation journals available for replay.

### Opt-in real local smoke

This developer harness is available only from an Atoll source checkout. It is
not included in the installed npm CLI. After deterministic checks, use a clean
loopback fixture profile with no current or conflicting retained job, and run
from `packages/cli`:

Loopback remains the normal default. Repository owners may also run one bounded
production validation turn from a clean Atoll source checkout. This mode requires
an exact canonical production origin, organization, project, authenticated agent,
issue, runner host and instance, and the live project repository mapping's opaque
`repo_ref` plus repository full name. The supplied `repo_ref` is checked against
live issue routing and must never be hard-coded. The smoke derives the canonical
source root from its own script, requires a clean source checkout, rebuilds the
candidate in the invocation, and records the source root, source `HEAD`, and
worker-entry SHA-256 in bounded mode-`0600` evidence. Exact production admission
performs zero presence `PUT`/upsert operations for either connected or
disconnected targets. Registration and refresh belong to separate operator setup
outside this invocation. The invocation reads the connected runner identity
before claim and rechecks it immediately before the claim; a disconnected target
fails closed. The runner does not explicitly select a model. The Codex runtime
and local Codex configuration supply model selection. `@openai/codex` and
`@openai/codex-sdk` are pinned to package/runtime version `0.153.4`; this
version is not a model name. Use the internal AH-2088 production smoke
runbook for the owner-only command and cleanup procedure.


```bash
cd packages/cli && bun run build
ATOLL_RUNNER_MANUAL_SMOKE=1 bun run runner:manual-smoke -- \
  --profile agent-a --issue issue-uuid --repository /path/to/checkout \
  --timeout-ms 300000 --evidence /absolute/path/evidence.json
```

The smoke runs one real Codex turn through the existing runner. It creates and
retains its owned local branch and worktree while preserving the primary
checkout, and writes bounded fixture issue, host, generation, branch/worktree,
base/head SHA, thread, terminal, and time evidence outside the checkout. A
timeout is always failure; retained journal state is authoritative. It never
pushes or deletes retained state, publishes, deploys, or installs a service.
Codex Desktop visibility is a separate operator observation; deterministic tests
use a fake SDK.
