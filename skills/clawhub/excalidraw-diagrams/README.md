Ask an agent for an Excalidraw diagram and it often writes the JSON by hand: boxes overlap, labels spill out and arrows float loose from their shapes. **Excalidraw Diagrams** is an Agent Skill that has your agent describe the diagram as a short spec of boxes, arrows and groups, then hands the drawing to a deterministic Python builder. You get a real Excalidraw file for Obsidian or excalidraw.com, laid out, labelled and bound, so it stays editable: move a box and its arrows follow.

## From spec to drawing

Real output, not a mock-up. The spec on the left is [examples/ci-pipeline.json](examples/ci-pipeline.json); the drawing on the right is what `build_diagram.py` wrote from it, exported with Excalidraw's own renderer.

Left to right works too, with groups, colors, a decision and an answer that loops back to the user ([examples/rag-architecture.json](examples/rag-architecture.json), sketch theme):

## How it works

1. The agent writes a temporary spec of nodes, edges and optional groups, for the destination and format you asked for.
2. `build_diagram.py` assigns layers, routes edges around nodes, sizes every label and binds text and arrows in both directions, with deterministic IDs.
3. `validate.py` checks the structure, the two-way bindings, fonts and overlapping shapes, and warns about edge crossings.
4. The agent fixes errors, adjusts direction, rank or node order for crossings, and returns the file path with any warning it could not resolve.

| Spec field | Values |
|---|---|
| `direction` | `TB` (top to bottom, default) or `LR` (left to right) |
| `theme` | `sketch` (hand-drawn, default) or `clean` (straight lines) |
| `font` | `excalifont` (default), `virgil`, `helvetica`, `cascadia`, `nunito`, `lilita`, `comic` |
| node `shape` | `rectangle` (default), `ellipse`, `diamond` |
| node and group `color` | `blue`, `green`, `red`, `orange`, `purple`, `yellow`, `cyan`, `pink`, `gray`, `white` |
| node `rank`, `link` | pin a node to a layer; attach a URL or an `[[Obsidian link]]` |
| edge `style` | `solid` (default), `dashed`, `dotted`, plus `"bidirectional": true` |

Layouts the builder cannot express, such as grids, can still be written by hand with the [file format reference](references/excalidraw-format.md) and then validated. The builder uses only Python's standard library, makes no network calls and never overwrites an existing file without `--force`.

## Install

OpenClaw is the primary target:

```bash
openclaw skills install @ricardodpalmeida/excalidraw-diagrams            # this workspace
openclaw skills install @ricardodpalmeida/excalidraw-diagrams --global   # all agents
```

The folder is a standard Agent Skill, so other agents that read `SKILL.md` can use it too. Clone it into the agent's skills folder under the skill's name:

| Agent | Command |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `git clone https://github.com/Ricardodpalmeida/openclaw-excalidraw-diagrams ~/.claude/skills/excalidraw-diagrams` |
| Codex | `git clone https://github.com/Ricardodpalmeida/openclaw-excalidraw-diagrams ~/.codex/skills/excalidraw-diagrams` |
| GitHub Copilot | `git clone https://github.com/Ricardodpalmeida/openclaw-excalidraw-diagrams ~/.copilot/skills/excalidraw-diagrams` |

The instructions call the skill folder `{baseDir}`: OpenClaw fills it in, and elsewhere it means the folder you cloned into. It needs Python 3.9 or newer and nothing else. Then ask in plain words, for example "draw our CI pipeline as an Excalidraw diagram in my Obsidian vault". The skill loads only for explicit Excalidraw requests.

To try the builder without an agent:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_diagram.py --spec examples/ci-pipeline.json --out ci-pipeline.excalidraw
python3 scripts/validate.py ci-pipeline.excalidraw
```

Open the file on excalidraw.com, or name it `.excalidraw.md` and open it in Obsidian with the Excalidraw plugin.
