# SOLO Mission Platform — Stuck Mission Recovery

These states arise when a previous session's monitoring loop did not finish its work
(e.g. the agent crashed mid-flow). They are not expected during normal operation:

- **`claim_refund`** should have been executed immediately after `settle_mission` returned `status: "refundable"`.
- **`emergency_refund`** should never occur if the loop settled before `settlement_deadline`.

If you see these at session start, resolve them now. Only your Sponsor wallet can
perform these on-chain actions.

`requires_sponsor_action` is set by a background job that runs every ~5 minutes and
reads the same `onchain_status`/`settlement_deadline` fields already in your state
file. Use it only in the [Session-Start Scan](#session-start-scan-quick-reference)
below. For any mission in your own state file, trigger directly from your own
tracked fields instead — never poll this flag for it:

- **`emergency_refund`** — trigger on `now > settlement_deadline` from your state file, every tick.
- **`claim_refund`** — trigger the instant `settle_mission` returns `status: "refundable"`, same tick.

---

## `requires_sponsor_action: "emergency_refund"`

**Situation:** `settlement_deadline` passed without a `settle_mission` call. Funds
are locked in EscrowVault in FUNDED or QUALIFIED state.

**Trigger:** `now > settlement_deadline` — act immediately, do not wait for the flag.

```
1. Call get_emergency_refund_params
   Response: {
     "success": true,
     "emergency_refund_params": {
       "escrow_vault_address": "0x...",
       "task_id": "0x...",
       "rpc_url": "https://sepolia.base.org",
       "chain_id": 84532,
       "contract_function": "emergencyRefund"
     }
   }

2. Execute on-chain:
   TX_HASH=$(cast send <escrow_vault_address> \
     "emergencyRefund(bytes32)" <task_id> \
     --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org \
     --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --json | jq -r '.transactionHash')

2a. Wait for receipt and check status (poll every 3 s, max 30 s):
   TX_STATUS=""; for i in $(seq 1 10); do
     S=$(cast receipt $TX_HASH --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.status // empty')
     [ "$S" != "" ] && TX_STATUS=$S && break; sleep 3
   done
   # status=0 means the on-chain call reverted. Two possible reasons:
   #   a) Task is already CANCELLED — continue to step 3 with empty body (confirm no-ops cleanly).
   #   b) Task is REFUNDABLE — settle_mission succeeded on-chain but Firestore was never updated.
   #      In this case emergencyRefund is not the right function. Check and switch flows:
   if [ "$TX_STATUS" = "0" ]; then
     CHECK=$(curl -s "https://api.mission.projectsolo.ai/agent/missions/$MISSION_ID/emergency-refund-params" \
       -H "X-Agent-Key: $SOLO_AGENT_KEY")
     HINT=$(echo $CHECK | jq -r '.hint // empty')
     if echo "$HINT" | grep -q "refund-params"; then
       echo "Task is already settled on-chain (REFUNDABLE). Switching to claim_refund flow."
       # Follow the claim_refund procedure below instead of continuing this flow.
       REFUND=$(curl -s "https://api.mission.projectsolo.ai/agent/missions/$MISSION_ID/refund-params" \
         -H "X-Agent-Key: $SOLO_AGENT_KEY")
       TASK_ID=$(echo $REFUND | jq -r '.refund_params.task_id')
       VAULT=$(echo $REFUND | jq -r '.refund_params.escrow_vault_address')
       TX_HASH=$(cast send $VAULT "claimRefund(bytes32,address)" $TASK_ID $WALLET_ADDRESS \
         --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --json | jq -r '.transactionHash')
       TX_STATUS=""; for i in $(seq 1 10); do
         S=$(cast receipt $TX_HASH --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.status // empty')
         [ "$S" != "" ] && TX_STATUS=$S && break; sleep 3
       done
       BODY=$([ "$TX_STATUS" = "1" ] && echo "{\"tx_hash\":\"$TX_HASH\"}" || echo "{}")
       for ATTEMPT in 1 2 3; do
         R=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.mission.projectsolo.ai/agent/missions/$MISSION_ID/confirm-refund" \
           -H "X-Agent-Key: $SOLO_AGENT_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
           -d "$BODY")
         echo $R | jq -e '.success' > /dev/null && break
         [ $ATTEMPT -lt 3 ] && sleep 5
       done
       echo "Done — mission status → refunded, unused budget returned."
       exit 0
     fi
   fi

3. Confirm with retry (backend RPC may lag ~5 s):
   BODY=$([ "$TX_STATUS" = "1" ] && echo "{\"tx_hash\":\"$TX_HASH\"}" || echo "{}")
   for ATTEMPT in 1 2 3; do
     R=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.mission.projectsolo.ai/agent/missions/$MISSION_ID/confirm-emergency-refund" \
       -H "X-Agent-Key: $SOLO_AGENT_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d "$BODY")
     echo $R | jq -e '.success' > /dev/null && break
     [ $ATTEMPT -lt 3 ] && sleep 5
   done
```

Result: mission status → `cancelled`, funds returned to Sponsor wallet.

## `requires_sponsor_action: "claim_refund"`

**Situation:** Mission settled but fewer than `max_humans` were qualified. Unused
budget is sitting in EscrowVault, awaiting `claimRefund()`.

**Trigger:** Mission `status === "refundable"`. Act within 24 hours.

```
1. Call get_refund_params
   Response: {
     "success": true,
     "refund_params": {
       "escrow_vault_address": "0x...",
       "task_id": "0x...",
       "rpc_url": "https://sepolia.base.org",
       "chain_id": 84532,
       "contract_function": "claimRefund",
       "refundable_amount_raw": "..."
     }
   }

2. Execute on-chain:
   TX_HASH=$(cast send <escrow_vault_address> \
     "claimRefund(bytes32,address)" <task_id> <recipient_address> \
     --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org \
     --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --json | jq -r '.transactionHash')

2a. Wait for receipt and check status (poll every 3 s, max 30 s):
   TX_STATUS=""; for i in $(seq 1 10); do
     S=$(cast receipt $TX_HASH --rpc-url https://sepolia.base.org --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.status // empty')
     [ "$S" != "" ] && TX_STATUS=$S && break; sleep 3
   done
   # status=0 means already refunded on-chain — continue to step 3 with empty body

3. Confirm with retry (backend RPC may lag ~5 s):
   BODY=$([ "$TX_STATUS" = "1" ] && echo "{\"tx_hash\":\"$TX_HASH\"}" || echo "{}")
   for ATTEMPT in 1 2 3; do
     R=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.mission.projectsolo.ai/agent/missions/$MISSION_ID/confirm-refund" \
       -H "X-Agent-Key: $SOLO_AGENT_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d "$BODY")
     echo $R | jq -e '.success' > /dev/null && break
     [ $ATTEMPT -lt 3 ] && sleep 5
   done
```

Result: mission status → `refunded`, unused budget returned to Sponsor wallet.

## Mission is `expired` (no flag)

`expired` means one of two things — **check which before assuming no action is needed:**

| Scenario | On-chain funds? | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Off-chain mission whose `expires_at` passed | None | No action required |
| On-chain mission emergency-refunded in a prior session | Already returned | No action required |
| On-chain mission that passed `settlement_deadline` with no settlement and no emergency refund | **Still locked** | `onchain_status` is `funded` or `qualified` — perform emergency refund now (see above) |
| On-chain mission where `settle_mission` succeeded on-chain but Firestore write failed | **Still locked** | `onchain_status` is `refundable` (Firestore stale) — perform claim refund now (see `requires_sponsor_action: "claim_refund"` above) |

If `onchain_status` is `cancelled` or `refunded`, funds are already recovered.
If `onchain_status` is `funded` or `qualified` on an `expired` mission, the reconciler
has not yet set `requires_sponsor_action` — act immediately without waiting for the flag.
If `onchain_status` is `refundable` on an `expired` mission, `settle_mission` completed
on-chain but its Firestore write failed — go straight to the `claim_refund` flow above.

---

## Mission is `pending_funding` with `funding_params.expires_at` in the past

You created an on-chain mission but did not fund it within the 1-hour window.
The `funding_params` object is now stale — **do not use it**.

- If `now < created_at + 86400s` (within 24 hours of creation): you can still fund
  using the fields stored on the mission doc — call `GET /agent/missions/:id` and map:

  | Mission doc field | `createTask` arg |
  |---|---|
  | `onchain_task_id` | `taskId` (bytes32) |
  | `token_address` | `token` |
  | `budget_raw` | `totalBudget` (uint96) |
  | `base_pool` | `basePool` (uint96) |
  | `qualify_deadline` | `qualifyDeadline` (uint64) |
  | `settlement_deadline` | `settlementDeadline` (uint64) |
  | `seed_commit` | `seedCommit` (bytes32) |

  Then call `confirm_funding` as normal. If the `qualify_deadline` has already passed
  (the mission window closed while unfunded), create a new mission instead.

- If `now >= created_at + 86400s`: the backend reconciler marks it `expired` — no
  action required.

---

## `confirm_funding` returned 409 "On-chain task does not match..."

The backend compares every value actually recorded on-chain for this `task_id`
(`totalBudget`, `basePool`, `lotteryRewardPerWinner`, `lotteryWinnerCount`,
`qualifyDeadline`, `settlementDeadline`, `seedCommit`, `token`) against what
`create_mission` returned in `funding_params`. This error means `createTask()`
was called with at least one different value — almost always a hand-typed or
re-derived number instead of copying the `funding_params` field verbatim.

**The mission cannot be recovered under this `task_id` — do not retry
`confirm_funding`.** `createTask()` requires `status == NONE` for a given
`taskId`, so a second `createTask()` call for the same mission will simply
revert with "Task exists"; there is no way to correct the on-chain values after
the fact.

Recovery:

1. **Mission stays `pending_funding`** on the backend — no participants can
   have been hired yet, so nothing is at stake for anyone but the escrowed funds.
2. Reclaim the escrow with `cancelTask(taskId)` (same contract call as the
   normal cancel flow — see `references/onchain.md`). This works regardless of
   which wrong values were used, since `cancelTask` only checks `status ==
   FUNDED` and refunds the real on-chain `totalBudget` in full to the Sponsor
   wallet.
3. Call `create_mission` again to get a fresh `task_id` and `funding_params`.
4. Fund it by copying every field from the **new** `funding_params` object
   directly (`jq -r '.funding_params.<field>'`) — do not reuse variables left
   over from the failed attempt, and do not type literal numbers by hand.

If participants were somehow already hired against this mission before funding
was attempted, that's a data-integrity bug in the platform, not something to
route through this doc's normal cancel flow — file it against `solo_firebase`
instead of retrying anything.

---

## On-chain `media_review` mission is `active` with no confirmed tracks

This happens when `confirm_funding` was called before any tracks were uploaded.
Track uploads are blocked once `status === 'active'` — **this mission cannot proceed
to settle**. The only exits are:

- **Hiring window still open** (`qualify_deadline` not yet passed): cancel via
  `cancel-params` → `cancelTask()` → `confirm-cancel`.
- **Hiring window closed, `settlement_deadline` not yet passed**: wait for
  `settlement_deadline`, then emergency-refund.
- **`settlement_deadline` passed**: emergency-refund immediately.

See the cancel/emergency-refund flows in the main SKILL.md.

## Session-Start Scan (quick reference)

Paginate through all missions — a single `limit=100` request misses missions beyond
page 1 for high-volume agents.

```bash
PAGE=1
while true; do
  RESULT=$(curl -s "https://api.mission.projectsolo.ai/agent/missions?limit=100&page=$PAGE" \
    -H "X-Agent-Key: $SOLO_AGENT_KEY")
  echo $RESULT | jq '.missions[] | select(.requires_sponsor_action != null) | {id: .mission_id, action: .requires_sponsor_action}'
  # Also catch expired on-chain missions the reconciler hasn't flagged yet
  # "refundable" means settle_mission ran on-chain but Firestore write failed — treat same as stuck
  echo $RESULT | jq '.missions[] | select(.status == "expired" and .onchain_status != null and (.onchain_status == "funded" or .onchain_status == "qualified" or .onchain_status == "refundable")) | {id: .mission_id, onchain_status: .onchain_status}'
  HAS_NEXT=$(echo $RESULT | jq -r '.pagination.has_next')
  [ "$HAS_NEXT" = "true" ] || break
  PAGE=$((PAGE+1))
done
```

For each result, match `action` (or `onchain_status`) to the procedures above and
resolve before continuing with other work.
