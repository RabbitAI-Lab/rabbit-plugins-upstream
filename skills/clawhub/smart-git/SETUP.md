# smart-git setup

Place the entire smart-git/ directory under the skills root where the current AI tool loads SKILL.md (the directory name must be smart-git). The config file `smart-commit.host-agent.json` must sit next to SKILL.md. Config resolve uses the copy actually loaded this turn; the host does not have to be one of the products in the table below.

This skill is named **`smart-git`**; the underlying CLI is **`smart-commit-host-agent`** (do not confuse the two).

## Install paths

Common paths (examples, not an allowlist; other Coding Agents work the same — install under the skills root documented by that tool):

| Tool | Personal skills (example) | Project skills (example) |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Cursor | ~/.cursor/skills/smart-git/ | <repo>/.cursor/skills/smart-git/ |
| Claude Code | ~/.claude/skills/smart-git/ | <repo>/.claude/skills/smart-git/ |
| Codex CLI | ~/.codex/skills/smart-git/ | <repo>/.codex/skills/smart-git/ or <repo>/.agents/skills/smart-git/ |
| Other Coding Agent | smart-git/ under that tool's personal / global skills root | smart-git/ under that tool's project skills root |

On Windows, ~ is the user home (for example %USERPROFILE%\.cursor\skills\smart-git\). scripts/*.sh need bash (Git Bash or WSL on Windows).

The same machine may install one copy per tool (each copy may have a different JSON). Scripts always use the copy actually loaded this turn and will not switch copies across tools. To temporarily use a different config, set SMART_GIT_CONFIG.

The directory must contain at least:

- SKILL.md
- HOST_AGENT_LOOP.md
- CONFIG.md
- smart-commit.host-agent.json
- scripts/discover-resolve-script.sh
- scripts/resolve-config.sh
- scripts/with-target-branch.sh

## Install the CLI

Prefer an existing install (need not be global). Use a global binary on PATH, a project-local node_modules binary, an explicit path via SMART_COMMIT_CLI, or a source build. Only when none of those is usable does the skill automatically globally install the package. Requires Node.js >= 20. If that install fails, the skill skips the business flow and will not pretend the CLI is installed.

## Environment variables

Create PR/MR, Review PR/MR, List my PRs/MRs, and Batch-review my PRs/MRs need a platform token. If those modes are unconfigured, the Agent stops and guides you to set SMART_COMMIT_PULL_REQUEST_AUTH_TOKEN.
Local Code Review (bridge with --review-only) and config resolve do not need a token; they can run without it.

Set SMART_COMMIT_PULL_REQUEST_AUTH_TOKEN in an environment loaded at shell startup (macOS / Linux: ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc then source; Windows: system env var or the current shell). The shell used by the current AI tool must be able to read it.
Do not send the token in the conversation.

GitLab: api scope (create/comment/merge MRs). GitHub: repo or the PR permissions required (set provider to github / auto). Default provider is auto.

## Personal config (diverse needs)

Recommended: edit smart-commit.host-agent.json next to this skill.
Stricter review, switch to GitHub, default assignees/reviewers, a different review skill, disable auto-approve/merge, disable auto-push, etc. all live in that file; you do not need to change SKILL.md.

Out-of-box defaults (see CONFIG.md):

| Field | Default |
|-------|---------|
| pullRequest.provider | auto |
| commitMessage.validation.protocol | none |
| commitMessage.scope | forbidden |
| pullRequestReview.autoApprove | true |
| pullRequestReview.autoMerge | true |
| pullRequestReview.summarySeverities | ["P0","P1"] |
| myPullRequest.listScope | account |
| myPullRequest.remoteHost | empty string |

For a fuller need-to-field map and caveats see CONFIG.md.

Quick lookup:

| Need | Field |
|------|-------|
| Local / Create-PR/MR review threshold | review.threshold (score > to pass; independent of the one below) |
| Existing PR/MR / batch-review threshold | pullRequestReview.threshold |
| Review / commit language | review.language, commitMessage.language |
| Review skill (built-in id / custom file) | review.skill.id, review.skill.path (absolute or relative to repo root), review.skill.promptTuning |
| Commit protocol / extra subject regex | commitMessage.validation.protocol (none/conventional/semantic/gitmoji), pattern (independent of protocol) |
| Require/forbid (scope) on the commit subject | commitMessage.scope (auto/required/forbidden; do not confuse with myPullRequest.listScope; no CLI flag) |
| Commit skill / draft refinement | commitMessage.skill (path supports absolute or relative to repo root), hybridGenerate (also needs input) |
| Platform (default auto) / self-hosted | pullRequest.provider, apiBaseUrl |
| List my PRs/MRs (host / scope / roles) | myPullRequest.remoteHost, listScope, listKinds |
| Batch-review my PRs/MRs (role filter) | myPullRequest.batchReviewKinds (default reviewer+assigned; independent of listKinds) |
| MR assignees, reviewers, labels, milestone, draft | pullRequestCreation.assignees, reviewers, labels, milestone, draft |
| MR title/description generation guidance | pullRequestCreation.titlePrompt, descriptionPrompt (non-empty titlePrompt stops overwriting title with a single commit subject) |
| Repo-level create/review overlay | pullRequestCreation.configFilePath, pullRequestReview.configFilePath (absolute / relative, comma-mixable) |
| Extra short instructions for PR/MR review only | pullRequestReview.skillPromptTuning (overrides review.skill.promptTuning) |
| Whether to create an MR after push | pullRequestCreation.autoCreateAfterPush |
| Disable auto-approve / merge | pullRequestReview.autoApprove / autoMerge to false |
| Include P2 in summaries | add P2 to pullRequestReview.summarySeverities |
| Whether to auto commit/push | git.autoCommit, git.autoPush |

The root key must be smartCommitHostAgent.
Do not put a plaintext token in the file; use env:SMART_COMMIT_PULL_REQUEST_AUTH_TOKEN.

The merge-into branch for Create PR/MR is produced by the skill calling scripts/with-target-branch.sh <config> <target> <Git root> to generate an ephemeral config: it first merges that repo's creation overlay, then writes targetBranch (the CLI has no target-branch flag) and does not rewrite the JSON you maintain long-term.

Temporarily use a different config file by setting SMART_GIT_CONFIG to an absolute path.

## Verify

Run discover-resolve-script.sh, then resolve-config.sh, then config resolve with --config pointing at the resolved file.
Optional: probe the turn protocol with host-agent probe using --session-base and --output json.
On Windows with no TMPDIR, use %TEMP% or Git Bash /tmp.

config resolve succeeding is enough (authToken may be empty). The first probe should return needs_host_agent. Platform modes also need the token already exported.

## Troubleshooting

If config is missing, confirm smart-commit.host-agent.json sits next to SKILL.md in a complete smart-git directory.
Missing SMART_COMMIT_PULL_REQUEST_AUTH_TOKEN: only Create PR/MR, Review, List, and Batch-review stop and guide you; Local Code Review continues. Do not send the token in chat.
Stuck on needs_host_agent: write a response JSON with the correct turnId and resume with --session.
Create PR/MR with no target branch: stop and ask (hard gate). Do not run with-target-branch.sh with an empty target, and do not guess main/master/develop.
discover/resolve cannot find the skill: directory name must be smart-git/ with scripts present.
If a diff is truncated or context is too long, raise review.maxDiffChars or split the MR.
Without Node 20+, skip the skill and install a current Node first.
