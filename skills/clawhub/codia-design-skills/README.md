# Codia Design Skills

Codia Design Skills gives local AI agents a reliable way to call Codia Open API from normal project work. After installation, an agent can inspect screenshots, convert PDFs into design data, generate or edit images, remove backgrounds, create SVG assets, export PDFs to PPT, and check account usage through the local `codia-design` command.

This repository is for agent skills. The skill files teach Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and other agents when to use Codia, which workflow to choose, and how to call the runtime safely. The runtime CLI is installed separately and performs the authenticated API requests on the user's machine.

You normally do not need to paste CLI commands into the agent. Ask for the outcome you want, provide local file paths or URLs, and let the agent pick the matching Codia skill.

## Quick Start

### Preferred (npx skills)

Install the Codia Design root skill pack from GitHub with `npx skills`:

```bash
npx -y skills add https://github.com/codia-ai/codia-design-skills.git -g -y
```

The default install creates one top-level `codia-design-skills` skill. Workflow and feature instructions live inside the pack under:

```text
SKILL.md
skills/<workflow-or-feature>/SKILL.md
```

The root skill handles routing and reads the relevant child `SKILL.md` file when a task needs specific parameters, model choices, or multi-step sequencing. Do not use `--full-depth` for normal installs unless you intentionally want every child skill installed as a separate top-level skill.

For a hands-off setup flow, give [AGENT_INSTALL.md](AGENT_INSTALL.md) to your agent and ask it to install Codia Design Skills.

## Use In An Agent

After installing the skill pack, start a new agent session or ask the agent to reload skills. Then describe the task in normal language. The agent will load the `codia-design-skills` root router, choose the right child workflow or feature instructions, check whether the `codia-design` CLI is installed, verify authentication, run the needed command, and report local output files or returned URLs.

Example agent requests:

```text
Use Codia to convert ./screenshot.png into editable design JSON and save it under ./outputs.
Use Codia to convert pages 0-4 of ./proposal.pdf into a PPT and also extract editable design data.
Use Codia to create a product launch asset pack from ./product.png with a white-background tile, a lifestyle scene, and a 16:9 banner.
Use Codia to generate a campaign poster, adapt it to 1:1, 4:5, and 9:16, and save all outputs in ./outputs.
Use Codia to remove the background from ./product.png and return a transparent PNG.
Use Codia to check my credits and recent usage.
```

Give the agent the source file path, desired page range, target sizes or aspect ratios, output directory, and any visual constraints that matter. For PDFs, page numbers are zero-based in Codia PDF APIs, so page `0` means the first page.

### Skill Routing

The top-level `codia-design-skills` skill is the router, setup, and workflow orchestration entry point. It is useful when the request is broad, account setup is needed, or several Codia tools must be chained together.

Common multi-step requests are handled by workflow instructions such as `codia-product-assets`, `codia-campaign-assets`, and `codia-document-deck`. Focused one-step requests are handled by feature instructions such as `codia-image-generate`, `codia-pdf-to-ppt`, `codia-remove-bg`, `codia-image-upscale`, `codia-image-reframe`, and `codia-credits`.

## Install The Runtime

### Automatic CLI bootstrap

The agent will check whether `codia-design` is available before calling Codia APIs. If the command is missing and the agent is allowed to run global npm installs, it may install the runtime automatically.

Manual install:

```bash
npm install -g @codia-ai/codia-design-cli
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
npm install -g @codia-ai/codia-design-cli
```

Update an existing install:

```bash
npm install -g @codia-ai/codia-design-cli@latest
```

Run without installing globally:

```bash
npx -y @codia-ai/codia-design-cli --help
```

## Connect An API Key

Use browser login when it is available:

```bash
codia-design auth login --platform codex
```

Or bind an API key directly:

```bash
codia-design auth set --api-key api_key_xxx
```

The CLI stores local auth state in:

```text
~/.codia/design-skills/config.json
```

Do not commit this file, print it in chat, or include it in a package archive.

## Verify Access

Run these checks after installing the skill and runtime:

```bash
codia-design --version
codia-design --help
codia-design auth status
codia-design credits
```

For command-specific guidance, run `codia-design <command> --help`, `codia-design image --help`, or `codia-design image <command> --help`.

## Optional Direct CLI Reference

These commands are mainly for manual debugging, local verification, or cases where an agent asks you to approve the exact command it plans to run.

```bash
codia-design image-to-design --image ./screenshot.png --out result.json
codia-design image-to-design --image https://example.com/large-screen.png --poll --out result.json
codia-design pdf-to-design --pdf ./file.pdf --pages 0,1 --out result.json
codia-design pdf-to-ppt --pdf ./file.pdf --pages 0,1,2 --title "Deck" --poll --out deck.json
codia-design image generate --prompt "modern product launch visual" --model seedream_5 --size 2560x1440 --download-dir ./outputs
codia-design image replace-bg --image ./product.png --prompt "clean white studio background" --model nano_banana_2 --download-dir ./outputs --out replace-bg.json
codia-design image upscale --image ./photo.png --model codia_image_v2 --download-dir ./outputs --out upscale.json
codia-design remove-bg --image ./product.png --download-dir ./outputs --out remove-bg.json
codia-design svg create --image ./logo.png --out svg-task.json
codia-design usage --page 1 --page_size 20
```

Image-output commands download returned images by default. Pass `--download-dir DIR` to choose the local output directory; the JSON response will include `data.local_file` or `data.local_files` next to the remote URL fields. Use `--no-download` only when a JSON-only response is required.

`image-to-design` supports both synchronous direct conversion and asynchronous Task API conversion. Use the default synchronous command for a single image or images below 2K on the longest edge. Use `--async` to submit an `image_to_design` task, or `--poll` to submit and wait for it, when processing multiple images or large 2K+ images. Async mode requires `--image` to be a public HTTPS URL; local image files are supported by synchronous direct upload.

The CLI calls the public Open API v2 surface (`/v2/open/*`). Billable commands estimate the `open_api_v2` credit cost before running, then query `codia-design credits` after the operation completes. If the remaining `available_credits` is below 2x the estimated cost, the CLI prints a reminder to stderr but does not block generation. Pass `--estimate` to show the estimate without sending the request. Common fixed prices are `pdf-to-design` 13 credits/page, `pdf-to-ppt` 13 credits/page, `image-to-design` 13 credits/request, `remove-bg` 13 credits/request, `image describe` 5 credits/request, `image layering` 27 credits/request, and `svg create` 13 credits/create. Image generation and several edit tools vary by model and resolution. Use `codia-design limits` or the API reference at `https://codia.ai/api-reference#description/introduction` for the live pricing and limits table.

PDF page numbering is zero-based across PDF APIs:

- `pdf-to-design --pages` is zero-based. Use `0` for the first page.
- `pdf-to-ppt --pages` is zero-based. Use `0` for the first page.

`pdf-to-ppt` follows the task workflow in the public API reference: local files are uploaded to `POST /v2/open/uploads` first, then the CLI creates `operation: "pdf_to_ppt"` with `POST /v2/open/tasks`, polls `GET /v2/open/tasks/:task_id`, and downloads `result.ppt_url`. The API expects NotebookLM-style image-only PDFs; report API errors directly and do not generate local substitute PPTX files unless explicitly requested.

## Security

Before publishing, packaging, or opening a pull request, scan for obvious secrets:

```bash
rg -n --hidden -S \
  -g '!.git' -g '!node_modules' -g '!dist' \
  '(CODIA_API_KEY|api_key_[A-Za-z0-9_-]+|Authorization: Bearer|BEGIN (RSA|EC|OPENSSH) PRIVATE KEY)' .
```

No output means this rule set did not find a matching plaintext secret. It is not a complete security audit.

Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for credential handling rules, local file permissions, and runtime bootstrap policy.

## Version

Current public skills release: `v0.1.1`

Requires CLI: `@codia-ai/codia-design-cli >=0.1.1`
