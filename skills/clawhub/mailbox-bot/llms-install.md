# mailbox.bot — Install Guide for AI Coding Agents

> For MCP-capable AI clients such as Cline, Cursor, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and other development tools.

## MCP Server (Remote — no local install needed)

mailbox.bot is a remote MCP server. For clients that support remote HTTP MCP servers, no npm install, Docker, or local process is required. Add this config and you're connected to 45 tools for outbound physical mail, agent mailboxes (a street address + PMB at the staffed, USPS-compliant Manhattan Beach, CA facility; Live now · invite only) and forwarded document context.

### Generic remote HTTP config

Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailbox-bot": {
      "url": "https://mailbox.bot/api/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer sk_agent_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

### Command bridge config

For clients that expect a local command, bridge the same remote server with `mcp-remote`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailbox-bot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mailbox.bot/api/mcp",
        "--header",
        "Authorization: Bearer sk_agent_..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailbox-bot": {
      "url": "https://mailbox.bot/api/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer sk_agent_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

### Cline

Add to Cline MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mailbox-bot": {
      "url": "https://mailbox.bot/api/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer sk_agent_..." }
    }
  }
}
```

## Get an API Key

1. Sign up at https://mailbox.bot/signup
2. Create an agent in the dashboard
3. Generate an agent-scoped API key (`sk_agent_...`)
4. Use a test key (`sk_agent_test_...`) for sandbox — no charges, same endpoints

## What You Get

45 MCP tools for outbound mail, agent mailboxes and inbound document context:

- **send_outbound_mail** — print and mail a PDF, DOCX, image, TXT, or CSV
- **cancel_outbound_mail** — cancel a queued piece while it is still `submitted` and report the refund
- **search_inbound_items** — search mail at the agent's assigned address by sender, reference and OCR text
- **request_inbound_action** — propose scan, forward or discard at the quoted price; the owner approves
- **list_inbound_forwarding_addresses** — retrieve the operator's private intake aliases
- **list_inbound_mail** — list forwarded inbound captures
- **get_inbound_mail** — fetch extracted context and `draft_context`
- **list_postal_threads** — list linked inbound/outbound physical-mail threads
- **get_mailbox_md** — fetch standing instructions
- And 36 more (agent mailbox items, pages, quotes and activity, agent inbox context, usage, facility messaging, webhook endpoints and deliveries, and sandbox mail lifecycle tools)

Stored outbound-mail submissions can include `document_preview_url` for human visual verification. Support conversations and attachments are REST/OpenAPI/dashboard features, not MCP tools.
