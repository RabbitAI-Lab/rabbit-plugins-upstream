# AEO Discovery (Tracked-Basket Expansion)

Discovery turns a free-text ICP description into a deduped basket of representative queries, probes each against Gemini grounding, and classifies the results into three buckets:

- **cited** — the project's canonical (or owned) domain appears in the grounding sources
- **wasted-surface** — a tracked competitor is cited but the project is not
- **aspirational** — neither the project nor a tracked competitor is cited (greenfield)

Plus a competitor map: every non-canonical domain that shows up in probe citations, ranked by hit count and classified by type, so the operator can spot recurring competitors that aren't yet on the watchlist.

After probing, one Gemini call classifies every recurring cited domain into a `competitorType`:

- **direct-competitor** — a business competing for the same customers (another hotel, another tool in the category). The only type promoted by default.
- **ota-aggregator** — OTAs, marketplaces, directories, review aggregators (expedia.com, booking.com, g2.com). Suppressed from competitor tracking.
- **editorial-media** — news, blogs, "best of" round-ups (timeout.com, a personal blog). A *channel* to earn placement in, not a competitor — suppressed by default.
- **other** — government sites, social platforms, off-topic domains. Suppressed.
- **unknown** — classification failed, or a session that pre-dates classification. Excluded from the default promote.

## When discovery is the right move

- Operator says "expand my tracked queries", "audit my basket", "what am I missing", "find competitors I should track".
- Recurring `wasted-surface` shows up in regression analysis — the project keeps losing on queries adjacent to its tracked basket.
- A new ICP is being onboarded and the operator only has a domain + tagline, no curated query list.

## Triggering a session

The operator runs:

```bash
cnry discover run <project> --icp "..." --wait
```

Or the MCP equivalent: `canonry_discover_run_start` with `{ project, request: { icpDescription, dedupThreshold?, maxProbes? } }`. The endpoint returns `{ runId, sessionId, status: "running" }` immediately and finishes the work in the background. Poll `canonry_discover_session_get` until `status` is `completed` or `failed`.

ICP fallback: if the request omits `icpDescription`, the route uses `projects.icp_description` if set. Surface a clear "needs an ICP" prompt if neither is available.

## Cost + budget

Per session: ~$1 at the default probe budget (100 queries × 1 Gemini grounded call each, plus a single batched embed call for ~$0.0002). Hard cap: 500 probes per session, enforced both client-side (Zod) and server-side. Recommend the default (100) unless the operator has a specific reason.

## Reading the result

`canonry_discover_session_get` returns:

- Session-level: `seedCountRaw` vs `seedCount` (proves embedding dedup did real work), bucket counts, `competitorMap` (top recurring non-tracked domains, each with `hits` and `competitorType`).
- Per-probe: query, bucket, citation state, the cited domains list.

Things to call out without being asked:

- **High wasted-surface ratio** (≥ 40% of probes, or > cited count at ≥ 20%) → the project is missing from its own competitive space. The auto-written `discovery.basket-divergence` insight flags this as `high` severity.
- **Recurring `direct-competitor` domains** in `competitorMap` that aren't already in the project's tracked competitor list → `cnry discover promote` adopts `direct-competitor` domains with at least 2 hits automatically alongside the queries; or add them à la carte with `cnry competitor add <project> <domain>`. Domains classified `ota-aggregator` / `editorial-media` / `other` are surfaced but **not** promoted by default — flag a recurring `editorial-media` site as a placement opportunity, not a competitor.
- **Aspirational greenfield** queries with no tracked competitor and no canonical cite → low-friction content opportunities.

## Promoting a session into the tracked basket

Once a session is `completed`, preview first unless the operator has already approved the write:

```bash
cnry discover promote preview <project> <session-id>
```

Or the MCP equivalent: `canonry_discover_promote_preview` with `{ project, sessionId }`.

The preview returns every bucket so you can explain the tradeoff:

- `cited` — already grounded to the project, safe to track.
- `aspirational` — greenfield ICP-fit opportunities, safe to track as a growth basket.
- `wasted-surface` — competitor-cited but project-missing. Treat as content-planning evidence first; do not add it to the weekly tracked basket unless the operator explicitly wants those off-ICP competitor gaps tracked.
- `suggestedCompetitors` — recurring domains (≥ 2 hits) not already tracked, of **every** classified type, each tagged with `competitorType`. The default promote adopts only the `direct-competitor` ones; the others are shown so you can recommend a `--competitor-types` widening.

Promote with one of these paths:

```bash
cnry discover promote <project> <session-id>                                          # cited + aspirational buckets + direct-competitor domains
cnry discover promote <project> <session-id> --bucket aspirational                    # scope to a bucket subset (repeatable / comma-separated)
cnry discover promote <project> <session-id> --bucket wasted-surface                  # explicitly track off-ICP competitor gaps
cnry discover promote <project> <session-id> --competitor-types direct-competitor,editorial-media   # widen the competitor merge to other classified types
cnry discover promote <project> <session-id> --no-competitors                         # queries only, skip the competitor merge
```

Or the MCP equivalent:

```json
{ "project": "<project>", "sessionId": "<session-id>" }
```

That default request promotes `cited` + `aspirational` queries and `direct-competitor` domains. For scoped writes, pass `request`:

```json
{ "project": "<project>", "sessionId": "<session-id>", "request": { "buckets": ["aspirational"], "competitorTypes": ["direct-competitor", "editorial-media"], "includeCompetitors": false } }
```

- **Default is cited + aspirational.** `wasted-surface` queries are off-ICP competitor gaps; promote them only when the operator explicitly wants those tracked in the weekly basket.
- **Competitor promotion requires recurrence + a promotable type.** The default competitor merge ignores one-off domains (< 2 hits) and adopts only domains classified `direct-competitor`. Pass `competitorTypes` (CLI: `--competitor-types`) to also adopt `editorial-media` channels, or `competitorTypes: ["unknown"]` to recover a legacy session promoted before classification existed.
- **Add-only and idempotent.** Queries and competitor domains already tracked are returned under `skipped`, never inserted twice. Re-running a promote is safe.
- **Completed sessions only.** Promoting a `queued`/`seeding`/`probing`/`failed` session is rejected — the buckets aren't final.
- Promoted rows carry `provenance="discovery:<sessionId>"`, so a tracked query can always be traced back to the session that surfaced it.

## When you wake on `aeo-discover-probe.completed`

The follow-up payload `RunCoordinator` queues for you includes:

```
[system] Discovery run <runId> completed for project <name> (session <sessionId>).
Buckets — cited:<n>, wasted-surface:<n>, aspirational:<n> (<probeCount> probes; seed provider: gemini).
Top recurring competitor domains: <domain1>(<hits>), <domain2>(<hits>), …
```

Respond with:

1. A one-line headline naming the dominant bucket.
2. The top 2-3 wasted-surface queries (call `canonry_discover_session_get` to fetch them — don't guess).
3. The top 1-2 recurring `direct-competitor` domains worth tracking, ignoring one-hit domains unless the operator asks for the full long tail. If a recurring `editorial-media` domain stands out, mention it separately as a placement opportunity — not a competitor.
4. A single recommended next step. Examples: "preview and promote cited + aspirational findings (`cnry discover promote preview`, then `cnry discover promote`)", "the wasted-surface set warrants a content plan around X before tracking", "the aspirational set is greenfield — pick the 3 with highest commercial intent and write content".

Do not recommend "promote everything" as the default. The safe path is: inspect session detail, preview promotion candidates, then promote the default cited + aspirational set. Escalate `wasted-surface` to tracking only when the operator deliberately chooses that tradeoff.

Keep it tight. The operator wakes to a short, decision-ready summary, not a full report.

## What discovery does NOT do (yet)

- **No multi-provider amplification.** v1 probes Gemini only. v2 will probe across Gemini + ChatGPT + Claude in one session (the schema is already shaped for it — `discovery_probes` has no `UNIQUE(session_id, query)` exactly because of this).
- **No re-run drift.** Each session is independent. Comparing sessions over time is on the PR 4 / PR 5 roadmap.

## Failure modes

- **Gemini not configured** → orchestrator throws early; `runs.status='failed'` with `Gemini provider is not configured.` Surface as "configure Gemini before running discovery" — link to `cnry init` or `~/.canonry/config.yaml`.
- **Vertex-only Gemini** → embeddings step throws (Vertex embeddings deferred). Same surface, "use a Gemini API key for now."
- **ICP missing** → route returns 400 with `VALIDATION_ERROR`. Ask the operator for the ICP description in plain language.
- **Seed collapse (hyperlocal/niche businesses)** → 40 raw seeds collapse to 1-2 canonical queries after embedding+clustering, even at low dedup thresholds. This happens when Gemini generates seed queries that all live in the same semantic pocket (e.g. all variants of "boutique hotel Venice Beach"). The embedding model sees them as near-identical, so clustering produces one representative.

  **Diagnostic signal:** `seedCountRaw / seedCount > 10:1` (e.g. 40 raw → 1 selected).

  **Remediation:** break the ICP into 3-5 distinct purchase-intent angles and run one session per angle via `--icp-angle`:

  ```bash
  cnry discover run <project> \
    --icp-angle "romantic anniversary stay in Venice Beach" \
    --icp-angle "best rooftop bars and dining hotels LA" \
    --icp-angle "walkable Venice Beach hotels near Abbot Kinney" \
    --icp-angle "design-forward boutique hotels for creative professionals" \
    --wait
  ```

  Each angle generates its own 40-seed cluster independently, so aggregate coverage grows while per-session dedup stays clean. The `--wait` output prints a combined summary with per-session session IDs and a `promote` command for each. Promote the sessions individually after reviewing previews.

## Memory hygiene

After a discovery session, store a one-liner in `agent_memory` if the operator validates a non-obvious call. Examples:

- `discovery:icp-style` — phrasing they responded well to
- `discovery:competitor-watchlist` — domains they explicitly accepted/rejected from the suggested list

Skip routine results — only memory-worthy material is what would help a future session avoid re-asking the same question.
