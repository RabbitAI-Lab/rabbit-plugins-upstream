# Diagram Generator

You create production-quality technical diagrams as standalone HTML files. Use this skill when the user asks for architecture diagrams, infrastructure diagrams, system topology, cloud diagrams, deployment maps, security boundaries, data flows, runtime flows, or process diagrams.

## Source of Truth

Load and follow these files before generating a diagram:

- `resources/generation-rules.md`
- `resources/diagram-ir.md`
- `resources/template.html`

## Required Behavior

1. Extract the system entities, relationships, boundaries, protocols, data stores, async paths, and operational risks.
2. Select the correct lens and output mode from `resources/generation-rules.md`.
3. Use `resources/diagram-ir.md` as the planning model before rendering.
4. If editing an existing diagram, inspect the current artifact first and preserve unrelated content, notes, and color semantics.
5. Generate one complete standalone `.html` file using `resources/template.html` as the base.
6. Replace every placeholder with concrete content from the user's brief or a clearly labeled assumption.
7. Run the final audit checklist in `resources/generation-rules.md` before returning the file.

Keep this file intentionally thin. Do not duplicate the shared design system, SVG rules, output-mode policy, or audit checklist here; update `resources/generation-rules.md` instead.

When asked to optimize a generated diagram, prefer the smallest edit that fixes the requested layout or routing defect. Do not rewrite the whole map unless the user asks for a redesign.

## Input Formats

This skill accepts three input formats and picks automatically based on what the user provides:

1. **Natural-language brief** — a textual description of the system and goal (the default; see `examples/architecture-brief.md`).
2. **Structured component list** — a YAML/JSON table of components and relations (see `examples/structured-input.yaml`), well suited to converting cloud resource inventories or existing configuration; components map to nodes and relations map to edges.
3. **Existing diagram-ir JSON** — pass a planning model that conforms to `resources/diagram-ir.md` directly, skipping the parsing stage to generate or revise a diagram; the revise workflow likewise reads the artifact's embedded IR first.

## Out of Scope

This skill generates **technical architecture and system diagrams** as standalone HTML/SVG. It is **not** for:

- Free-form illustration, hand-drawn sketches, or pixel-art.
- Statistical charts (bar, line, pie) — use a charting library or spreadsheet.
- Pixel-perfect UI mockups or marketing visuals — use a design tool.
- Complex non-orthogonal connector routing (curved splines, bezier) — the built-in checker validates orthogonal paths; complex curves degrade to a W004 warning prompting manual review.
- draw.io-first production output — `html + drawio xml` is experimental; default to `html-first`.
- Oversized inputs — with more than ~40 nodes or ~60 edges, prefer splitting into multiple single-lens diagrams or moving secondary paths into the notes rail instead of crowding one diagram.

Language: output labels and notes in the user's preferred language (Chinese or English).

## FAQ

**Q: The checker reports an edge collinear with a node or region border. What do I do?**
A: Reroute the connector so it exits a node edge perpendicularly and travels in the free space between nodes. Never run a connector along the outer edge of its own source or target node, and avoid segments that share more than ~12 px with any region border.

**Q: A node overlaps a region it should sit inside.**
A: The checker enforces a 10 px gutter between every node and the region border. Shrink the node or expand the region; do not place nodes flush against a border.

**Q: The generated HTML has leftover placeholder text.**
A: `resources/template.html` uses plain-text placeholders (e.g. `System Map Title`, `One sentence that states...`); all of them must be replaced with concrete content. The checker detects these placeholder strings (E010) and fails on any residue. Do not leave template defaults in a delivered artifact.

**Q: Can I edit an existing diagram instead of regenerating it?**
A: Yes — prefer local coordinate and connector changes over full regeneration. Inspect the current artifact first and preserve unrelated nodes, notes, and color semantics.
