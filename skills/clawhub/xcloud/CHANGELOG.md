# Changelog

All notable changes to the xCloud Public API skill are documented in this file.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Closed the live API coverage gaps: `GET /vulnerabilities`,
  `PUT /sites/{uuid}/git`, `POST /sites/{uuid}/git/deploy`, and
  `POST /servers/{uuid}/services/disable`.
- Added `xcloud:sites` Git deployment guidance for reading/updating deployment
  settings and triggering manual deploys.
- Added team-wide vulnerability rollup guidance to `xcloud:wordpress`.
- Added safer proactive token onboarding: xCloud now prompts users to configure
  `XCLOUD_API_TOKEN` in the runtime/secret store and verifies with `/health` +
  `/user`, without defaulting to raw token collection in chat.
- Added direct xCloud tutorial/video/YouTube links to README, root `SKILL.md`,
  and ClawHub metadata for better marketplace and search indexing.

### Changed

- Changed marketplace category metadata from `infrastructure` to `deployment`.
- Strengthened xCloud-branded greeting/startup guidance so first-run replies feel
  more helpful and productized.
- Refreshed `docs/API-COVERAGE.md`: current skill docs cover **111/111** live
  OpenAPI operations, with only the 9 caveated database/database-user operations
  remaining outside the live spec.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- Restored the original `xcloud` ClawHub listing so the public release keeps its existing download history.
- Refreshed the first-screen README badges to match successful Asif2BD ClawHub listings: ClawHub, version, license, xCloud, and OpenClaw.
- Refreshed the rendered `SKILL.md` tab with Token Optimizer-style badges, first-screen xCloud/GitHub/guide/API/security links, and a security notice for the existing ClawHub listing.
- Added direct links to xCloud, the xCloud dashboard, GitHub, the User Guide, the Install & Usage Guide, and the Public API docs in both README and marketplace metadata.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **ClawHub release metadata**: root `SKILL.md`, `.clawhubignore`, `.clawhubsafe`,
  scanner-focused `SECURITY.md`, README badges, and official marketplace links
  for ClawHub and skills.mp.com indexing.
- **API coverage audit** (`docs/API-COVERAGE.md`): every documented endpoint
  cross-checked against the live OpenAPI (111 operations). Skills cover 108 of
  them; 3 live operations are undocumented (`PUT /sites/{uuid}/git`,
  `POST /sites/{uuid}/git/deploy`, `POST /servers/{uuid}/services/disable`) and 9
  documented `databases`/`database-users` operations are absent from the spec
  **and verified to return HTTP 404 on live servers (2026-06-29)** — now carrying
  a prominent "not available on the current public API" caveat in
  `reference/databases.md`. Clarifies that "117" is the skill-side count, not the
  API's 111-operation surface; ADR 0001 and the 2.0.0 note were corrected
  accordingly. All five smoke suites were run green against the live API
  (servers: 7 passed / 1 skipped for the `databases` 404 / 0 failed).
- **Minimal CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lints every shell script
  (`bash -n` + ShellCheck) and validates the JSON manifests on each push/PR, and
  runs the read-only smoke suites when an `XCLOUD_API_TOKEN` secret is configured
  (skips cleanly otherwise).

### Fixed

- **`xcloud:account` token revocation now matches the live API.** The skill
  documented `DELETE /user/tokens/{tokenId}` as a numeric id, but the API keys
  revocation by the token's `uuid` (live OpenAPI: `DELETE
  /user/tokens/{tokenUuid}`, `string`/`uuid`) and `GET /user/tokens` returns
  `uuid`. Corrected the endpoint, made the list example surface `uuid` (so the
  revoke flow is completable from list output), and fixed the matching note in
  `reference/conventions.md` and the skill pitfall.

### Changed

- **Smoke suites tolerate unsupported sub-resources.** A new `check_opt` helper
  treats `404` (and `422` "not supported") on optional, type-dependent
  sub-resources as **SKIP** instead of **FAIL** — applied to server `databases`,
  site `backups`/`cache`, the WordPress `pagespeed` latest scan, and site `ssl`.
  Summary lines now report passed/skipped/failed.
- **Removed non-standard SKILL.md frontmatter keys** (`version`/`author`/
  `license`) from all five skills — `name`/`description` only, per the SKILL.md
  schema. Version/author/license now have a single source of truth in
  `plugin.json`, avoiding drift across six files on each release.
- **Reconciled `requirements.txt`** with `.clawhubinfo.json`'s stated versions:
  `requests>=2.28.0`, `backoff>=2.2.0`.
- **Documented `XCLOUD_API_BASE_URL`** in `.env.example` (commented), so local /
  white-label hosts are discoverable without reading the source.
- **Public identity realigned to the skills.** The README now leads with the five
  `xcloud:*` skills, install, and usage; the Python SDK/CLI is reframed as a
  legacy `src/` track. `.clawhubinfo.json` bumped to `3.0.1`, its stale
  `api_info.version` corrected to the live API's `1.0.0`, and its
  features/badges/quick-start reframed from SDK-centric to skill-centric.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-16

### Changed (BREAKING)

- Renamed the plugin from `xcloud-public-api` to **`xcloud`**, and shortened each
  skill's name to its bare capability. Skills are now invoked as **`xcloud:servers`**,
  **`xcloud:sites`**, **`xcloud:ssl`**, **`xcloud:wordpress`**, and **`xcloud:account`**
  (previously `xcloud-public-api:xcloud-servers`, etc.).
- The plugin directory moved from `plugins/xcloud-public-api/` to `plugins/xcloud/`,
  and each skill directory was shortened to match (`skills/servers/`, `skills/sites/`,
  `skills/ssl/`, `skills/wordpress/`, `skills/account/`).
- **Breaking:** the skill IDs changed. Users must reinstall the plugin
  (`/plugin install xcloud`) and update any explicit skill references to the new
  `xcloud:<capability>` form. No behavior or coverage changed — names only.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-09

### Changed (BREAKING)

- Replaced the single `xcloud-public-api` skill with **five capability-domain
  skills**: `xcloud-servers`, `xcloud-sites`, `xcloud-wordpress`, `xcloud-ssl`,
  `xcloud-account`. The v1 single skill is preserved at the `v1.2.0` git tag.
- Skills are organized by **capability, not URL root**; each description declares
  what it does *not* own with `see xcloud-*` cross-links to keep trigger keywords
  from colliding. See `docs/adr/0001-capability-domain-skills.md`.

### Added

- Coverage expanded to a 117-operation skill surface (PHP versions, databases,
  firewall/fail2ban, cron, snapshots, services, vulnerabilities, PageSpeed,
  WordPress plugin/theme management, SSL certificate lifecycle, and more).
- Shared plugin layer: one `scripts/xcloud.sh` + `reference/{auth,conventions}.md`
  referenced by every skill via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` — no per-skill duplication.
- Per-skill `tests/smoke.sh`; large domains carry `reference/<sub-resource>.md`
  loaded on demand.
- Base URL is environment-driven (`XCLOUD_API_BASE_URL`) — local (`xcloud.test`)
  vs live (`app.xcloud.host`) needs no code change.
