const INFO_DESCRIPTION = `
The **xCloud agent skills** let any AI agent (Claude Code, OpenCode, and others)
operate xCloud in plain language — *"reboot my Hermes server"*, *"renew SSL for
example.com"*, *"scan example.com for vulnerabilities"*. You describe what you
want; the agent picks the right skill and chains the steps.

> **Skills repo:** <https://github.com/xCloudDev/xcloud-agent-skills>
> **User guide:** <https://github.com/xCloudDev/xcloud-agent-skills/blob/main/docs/USER_GUIDE.md>

## xCloud API

These skills wrap the **xCloud Public API**. For the full REST reference — every
endpoint, request/response schema, and an interactive try-it console — see:

### → [xCloud API](${XCLOUD_API_DOCS_URL})

## The five skills

You never name them — the agent picks the right one from what you ask.

| Skill | Owns |
|---|---|
| \`xcloud:servers\` | Servers, PHP, databases, cron, firewall/fail2ban, sudo users, WordPress provisioning |
| \`xcloud:sites\` | Site lifecycle: status, backups, domains, cache, SSH, site cron, git |
| \`xcloud:wordpress\` | WP plugins/themes/updates, WP_DEBUG, magic login, vulnerabilities, PageSpeed |
| \`xcloud:ssl\` | SSL certificates: view, install, renew, status, delete |
| \`xcloud:account\` | Current user, API tokens, Cloudflare integrations, blueprints, health |

## Install in Claude Code

1. **Install the plugin:**

   \`\`\`
   /plugin marketplace add xCloudDev/xcloud-agent-skills
   /plugin install xcloud
   /reload-plugins
   \`\`\`

2. **Add your API token.** Get one from the xCloud dashboard → **Profile → API
   Tokens → Generate New Token** (copy it once). Then add to
   \`~/.claude/settings.json\`:

   \`\`\`json
   { "env": { "XCLOUD_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here" } }
   \`\`\`

   Restart Claude Code so it picks up the token.

3. **Check it works.** Ask Claude: *"Check my xCloud API connection."* Green
   light = you're ready.

That's it — everything below is just talking to Claude.

## Example requests

You don't name skills or endpoints — describe what you want in plain language and
Claude picks the right skill and chains the steps. Hover any request below and use
the copy button.

**One-liners**

\`\`\`text
List my xCloud servers.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`text
Is example.com up right now?
\`\`\`

\`\`\`text
Renew the SSL certificate for shop.example.com.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`text
Update all plugins on example.com, but back up first.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`text
Scan example.com for vulnerabilities and show me the critical ones.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`text
Something's hammering my server from 203.0.113.7 — block it.
\`\`\`

**Multi-step workflows** — each is a single request; Claude does the chaining.

*Monday-morning health audit* — checks the site is serving, inspects SSL expiry,
runs a vulnerability scan, and runs a PageSpeed scan, then returns one summary.

\`\`\`text
Audit example.com — is it up, is SSL healthy, any vulnerabilities, and how's performance?
\`\`\`

*Safe WordPress update* — takes a labelled backup and waits for it, applies the
update, then confirms the site is still healthy. Follow up with *"restore the
backup you just took"* to roll back.

\`\`\`text
WooCommerce has an update — apply it to example.com, but back up first and tell me if anything looks off.
\`\`\`

*New site go-live* — installs a Let's Encrypt certificate, waits for issuance,
verifies HTTPS, and runs a baseline PageSpeed scan.

\`\`\`text
I just provisioned shop.example.com — set up HTTPS and confirm it's serving.
\`\`\`

*Triage a site that's down* — pulls site status, recent events, and SSH/user
config to spot the usual culprits (stopped service, missing OS user, failed
deploy).

\`\`\`text
example.com is throwing 502 errors — what's going on?
\`\`\`

> If Claude ever reaches for the wrong area, name it:
> \`Using xcloud:ssl, renew the cert for example.com.\`

## Authentication & token

The skills authenticate to the xCloud Public API with a
[Sanctum personal access token](https://laravel.com/docs/sanctum). Generate one
in the xCloud dashboard → **Profile → API Tokens → Generate New Token**, choosing
scopes (\`read:sites\`, \`write:sites\`, \`read:servers\`, \`write:servers\`, or
\`*\`). It's shown once — copy it immediately, then add it to
\`~/.claude/settings.json\` as shown above.

For full auth details, scopes, and the endpoint reference, see the
[xCloud API](${XCLOUD_API_DOCS_URL}).

const doc = {
  openapi: '3.1.0',
  info: {

  // No contact / license / externalDocs — they render in Scalar's right column,
  // which we don't want. The "xCloud API" link lives in the description body.
  // Intentionally empty: this is a guide/landing page, not an endpoint reference.
