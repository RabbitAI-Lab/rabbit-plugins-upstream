## Overview

**Ad Copy Fatigue Detector & Refresher** is an enterprise-grade creative intelligence tool that monitors advertising campaign performance across Facebook, Google Ads, and LinkedIn in real-time. It automatically identifies when ad copy variants are experiencing performance degradation (declining CTR, rising CPC, or stalling engagement), then generates micro-pivot suggestions—headline reframes, CTA redirects, benefit reshuffles—without requiring manual A/B test setup.

### Why This Matters

Ad fatigue costs businesses 15-40% of ad spend efficiency annually. Traditional solutions require marketers to:
1. Manually pull performance reports weekly
2. Visually inspect CTR/CPC trends
3. Guess at what to change
4. Set up new A/B tests and wait days for results

This skill automates steps 1-3 and jumpstarts step 4 with data-driven micro-pivot suggestions informed by 50+ years of combined advertising dynamics research (Facebook Feed Algorithm, Google Smart Bidding, LinkedIn Sponsored Content best practices).

### Key Integrations
- **Facebook Ads Manager API** (real-time campaign sync)
- **Google Ads API** (Search & Display network analysis)
- **LinkedIn Campaign Manager API** (B2B targeting insights)
- **Slack** (alert notifications on fatigue detection)
- **Zapier** (workflow automation for bulk creative rotation)
- **OpenAI GPT-4** (micro-pivot generation engine)

## Quick Start

### Example 1: Detect Fatigue Across All Active Campaigns
```
Analyze my Facebook and Google Ads accounts for copy fatigue. 
Flag any ad variations showing CTR drop >15% or CPC increase >20% 
in the last 14 days. Show me a fatigue risk score for each.
```

**What happens:** The skill connects to your ad accounts, pulls the last 14 days of performance data, calculates CTR/CPC degradation trends, and returns a dashboard with risk scores and flagged variations.

---

### Example 2: Generate Micro-Pivot Suggestions for Underperforming Copy
```
My Google Search campaign headline "Best Project Management Software" 
is showing fatigue (CTR down 18% week-over-week). 
Generate 5 alternative headlines using micro-pivots: reframe the benefit, 
swap CTA language, and add social proof triggers.
```

**What happens:** The skill analyzes the original copy structure, identifies the specific fatigue pattern, and generates variations targeting urgency, specificity, and authority signals.

**Sample output:**
```
Original: "Best Project Management Software"
Risk Score: 8.2/10 (High Fatigue)

Micro-Pivot Suggestions:
1. "Project Management That Cuts Admin Work 47%" (Specificity Pivot)
   Rationale: Adds quantified benefit; targets pain point efficiency
   Estimated CTR Lift: +8-12%

2. "Teams Are Shipping 3x Faster With [Tool]" (Social Proof Pivot)
   Rationale: Third-party validation; competitive differentiation
   Estimated CTR Lift: +6-10%

3. "Stop Wasting Time in Meetings—Try Our PM Tool Free" (CTA Reframe)
   Rationale: Negative-to-positive urgency; removes friction
   Estimated CTR Lift: +5-9%

4. "The #1 PM Tool For Remote Teams (5,000+ Companies Trust Us)" (Authority + Specificity)
   Rationale: Double-trigger (social proof + segment specificity)
   Estimated CTR Lift: +10-14%

5. "Manage Projects Like Top 1% Teams—See Why" (Aspiration + Curiosity)
   Rationale: Identity-based messaging; curiosity gap
   Estimated CTR Lift: +7-11%
```

---

### Example 3: Schedule Automatic Weekly Fatigue Audits & Slack Alerts
```
Set up automated fatigue detection on my Facebook and LinkedIn accounts. 
Run analysis every Monday at 9 AM. Alert me on Slack if any ad variant 
shows >15% CTR drop or >25% CPC increase. Include refresh suggestions 
in the Slack notification.
```

**What happens:** The skill configures a scheduled job that runs Monday mornings, compares performance against baseline, and sends actionable Slack messages with suggested pivots ready to A/B test.

## Capabilities

### 1. **Real-Time Fatigue Detection**
- Connects to Facebook Ads Manager, Google Ads, and LinkedIn Campaign Manager APIs
- Analyzes performance across: CTR, CPC, ROAS, Engagement Rate, Cost Per Lead
- Calculates week-over-week and month-over-month degradation rates
- Flags variations at risk using proprietary fatigue scoring (0-10 scale)
- Excludes seasonal/budget-related fluctuations from analysis

**Usage:**
```
Run fatigue detection on my top 10 Facebook campaigns. 
Show me which ad sets are underperforming, when the fatigue started, 
and the 7-day degradation trend.
```

### 2. **Micro-Pivot Suggestion Engine**
- Analyzes underperforming copy using NLP (OpenAI GPT-4 backbone)
- Identifies fatigue type: benefit erosion, CTA fatigue, audience saturation, creative wear
- Generates 3-7 alternative copy variations for each ad
- Each variation uses ONE micro-pivot: headline reframe, benefit reshuffle, CTA redirect, authority addition, urgency trigger
- Includes estimated CTR/CPC impact based on historical pattern matching

**Usage:**
```
My LinkedIn Sponsored Content ad "Join 10,000+ Professionals Learning AI" 
is showing 12% CTR decline. What micro-pivots should I test? 
Generate alternatives using: specificity, social proof, urgency, and curiosity.
```

### 3. **Copy Health Scoring**
- Assigns a Fatigue Risk Score (0-10) to each ad variation
- Tracks: age of copy, impression count, click decay rate, engagement velocity
- Predicts time-to-fatigue (when CTR will likely drop 20%+)
- Compares against industry benchmarks (by vertical, ad platform, device type)

**Usage:**
```
Score the copy health of all my Google Search ads. 
Show me which ads are healthy, which are at risk, and which are critically fatigued. 
Rank by days-until-predicted-fatigue.
```

### 4. **A/B Test Auto-Setup**
- Generates A/B test recommendations with control/variant pairs
- Suggests sample size and duration based on baseline performance
- Integrates with Zapier to automatically create test variants in your ad platform
- Tracks test performance and reports winner back to your dashboard

**Usage:**
```
Take my top 3 micro-pivot suggestions for this underperforming Facebook ad. 
Set up A/B tests: control vs. each variant. 
Run for 7 days or until statistical significance. Alert me when done.
```

### 5. **Historical Performance Trending**
- Pulls 90-day historical performance data across all platforms
- Identifies performance patterns by: time of day, day of week, audience segment, device type
- Detects seasonal fatigue vs. structural copy decay
- Highlights which micro-pivots worked best in the past for similar ads

**Usage:**
```
Show me a 90-day performance trend for my Google Display campaigns. 
Which ad copy variations recovered best from fatigue? 
Use those patterns to suggest refreshes for my current declining ads.
```

### 6. **Slack & Email Alerting**
- Real-time notifications when fatigue is detected
- Weekly digest summaries with top action items
- One-click approval to launch suggested A/B tests
- Tracks notification performance (how many alerts led to action)

**Usage:**
```
Configure Slack alerts for my team. Notify #marketing-ads 
whenever a Facebook ad shows >20% CTR decline. 
Include the fatigue risk score and top 2 micro-pivot suggestions.
```
