# FarmDash Wagon Steward

> [!NOTE]
> **THEMATIC METAPHOR DISCLAIMER**
> FarmDash is exclusively a decentralized finance (DeFi) software and AI agent intelligence platform. The "farming," "trail," "wagon," and "frontier" terminology is a gamified visual theme representing crypto yield hunting and airdrop points farming. It does not relate to physical agriculture or agrifood industries.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ZERO-CUSTODY CRITICAL BOUNDARY**
> This skill is strictly a read-only portfolio aggregation surface and does NOT execute any state-changing swaps, deposits, or perps, nor does it request, hold, or transmit private keys, seed phrases, or mnemonics.

> **Security Posture.** Strict read-only. Every tool is a GET endpoint that returns analysis derived from public on-chain data. No environment variables are required for the free tier. The optional Bearer token raises rate limits only and is sent solely as an Authorization header to `https://www.farmdash.one`. Wagon Steward cannot modify wallet state, approve allowances, or initiate any on-chain action. Recommendations are research output; the user's separately-installed execution skill is responsible for any on-chain action under its own ClawScan-reviewed contract.

## What this skill does

Wagon Steward is the **read-only mirror of the user's farming state**. Where Trail Intelligence answers "what is happening in DeFi," Wagon Steward answers "what is happening in your wallet."

It produces analysis, not transactions. Every output is a research snapshot the user reviews and can act on, at their own pace, through whichever execution skill they have separately installed.

**MCP Configuration:** `https://www.farmdash.one/.well-known/mcp.json`

---

## Permissions

Wagon Steward requires only the user's public wallet address (the same value visible on any block explorer) and, for Pioneer-tier rate limits, an optional Bearer token. It does not request, accept, or transmit any other credentials. It defines no write capabilities. Recommendations are returned as JSON for the agent to surface to the user; if the user chooses to act, the action is performed by their own separately-installed execution skill under that skill's own ClawScan-reviewed contract.

---

## Data sent to FarmDash MCP

| Field | Sent? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Public wallet address (`0x…`) | Yes, every call | Public information — same as a block-explorer query |
| Chain IDs to inspect | Yes, optional | Public values |
| Bearer token, if provided | Yes, Authorization header | Tier identification only |

No other fields are collected by skill logic.

**Self-hosting option:** Wagon Steward endpoints are documented in the FarmDash unified OpenAPI spec at `https://www.farmdash.one/agents/openapi.yaml`.

---

## Tier Model

| Tier | Cost | Limits | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scout** | Free | 5 req / 24h | Public FarmDash discovery only; wallet portfolio endpoints require Pioneer because they consume portfolio API credits |
| **Pioneer** | $39.99/mo | 500 req / day | Wallet balances, portfolio summary, idle capital, token prices, position/performance health |
| **Syndicate** | $199/mo | 50k req / day | Higher-rate portfolio loops, webhooks through Signal Architect, unrestricted CORS, and advanced session/control tooling for teams and serious agents |

---

## Available Tools

### Current MCP Tool Map (v0.6)

The current FarmDash MCP server exposes these Wagon-relevant tools directly:

- `get_wallet_balances`
- `get_portfolio_summary`
- `get_position_health`
- `get_idle_capital`
- `get_token_prices`
- `get_agent_performance`

This SKILL.md also defines useful agent procedures named `get_capital_efficiency`, `get_rebalance_plan`, and `watch_wagon`. Preserve those names in reasoning and UI copy, but do not call them as MCP tools unless the runtime explicitly exposes them. Today they are derived procedures:

- `get_capital_efficiency` = derive from `get_portfolio_summary`, `get_idle_capital`, concentration, priced tokens, and stale-position signals.
- `get_rebalance_plan` = pair Wagon state with Signal Architect `optimize_portfolio` and fresh swap quotes.
- `watch_wagon` = implement as an agent loop using repeated reads plus Signal Architect webhooks when the user has Syndicate access.

If a user asks for one of the derived procedures, execute the underlying current tools and label the result as "derived by the agent from FarmDash wallet data."

### `get_portfolio_summary` (Pioneer)

Top-level snapshot. Use this first — it grounds every other recommendation.

**Inputs:** current MCP uses `address` (required EVM address) and optional `chains` (comma-separated Alchemy network IDs such as `eth-mainnet,base-mainnet`). Legacy examples may say `walletAddress`; map that to `address` before calling.

**Returns:**

```
{
  "totalValueUSD": 12480.32,
  "byChain": [
    { "chainId": 1, "chainName": "Ethereum", "valueUSD": 6200.00, "percent": 49.7 },
    { "chainId": 8453, "chainName": "Base", "valueUSD": 3100.50, "percent": 24.8 },
    ...
  ],
  "byAsset": [
    { "symbol": "ETH", "valueUSD": 5400.00, "percent": 43.3 },
    { "symbol": "USDC", "valueUSD": 3200.50, "percent": 25.6 },
    ...
  ],
  "topProtocolPositions": [
    { "protocol": "etherfi", "valueUSD": 2400.00, "asset": "weETH" },
    ...
  ],
  "asOf": "2026-05-12T18:00:00Z"
}
```

**Agent posture:** Start a wagon-aware conversation with this tool when the user has Pioneer access. If the call returns 402, explain that wallet portfolio reads require Pioneer and continue with non-wallet public research instead of fabricating balances. Do not narrate the entire response; surface the totals plus any flags Wagon Steward returns or that you derive (over-concentration, large idle capital, stale positions).

---

### `get_position_health` (Pioneer)

Per-position deep-dive: APR, age, unrealized P&L, IL exposure, and a rebalance hint.

**Inputs:** current MCP uses `address`. Legacy examples may say `walletAddress`; map that to `address` before calling.

**Returns:**

```
{
  "positions": [
    {
      "protocol": "etherfi",
      "chain": "ethereum",
      "asset": "weETH",
      "valueUSD": 2400.00,
      "apr": 3.4,
      "aprDelta30d": -0.6,
      "impermanentLossUSD": 0,
      "daysSinceEntry": 47,
      "rebalanceHint": "hold",
      "notes": "APR drifting; still above stablecoin alternatives."
    },
    {
      "protocol": "aerodrome",
      "chain": "base",
      "asset": "USDC-WETH LP",
      "valueUSD": 1800.00,
      "apr": 12.8,
      "aprDelta30d": 1.2,
      "impermanentLossUSD": -42.50,
      "daysSinceEntry": 12,
      "rebalanceHint": "monitor",
      "notes": "IL accelerating with WETH up 6%; reassess if 5-day IL > $80."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Agent posture:** Treat `rebalanceHint` as a discussion starter, never a directive. Always pair the hint with the *reason* in `notes` so the user can override.

| Hint | Meaning | Suggested phrasing |
|---|---|---|
| `hold` | Position is healthy at the user's risk tier | "Looks fine; keep watching APR drift." |
| `monitor` | Drift detected but not actionable yet | "Worth checking again in 3–7 days." |
| `reduce` | Concentration or IL exceeds soft limits | "Consider trimming on the next strong candle." |
| `exit` | Risk gate breached or thesis broken | "The case has weakened; here's why." |
| `add` | Allocation is below target and APR is favorable | "If you have idle capital, this slot has room." |

---

### `get_idle_capital` (Pioneer)

Surfaces stablecoins or unstaked native assets sitting unused.

**Inputs:** current MCP uses `address`. `minThresholdUSD` is a derived agent display filter; apply it after the response if needed.

**Returns:**

```
{
  "totalIdleUSD": 1860.00,
  "items": [
    {
      "chain": "arbitrum",
      "asset": "USDC",
      "amountUSD": 1240.00,
      "opportunityCostPerDay": 0.41,
      "topYieldOption": { "protocol": "aave-v3", "apr": 12.0 }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Agent posture:** Mention idle capital exactly once per conversation — repeated mention turns into nagging. If the user wants to deploy it, hand off to Trail Marshal `idle_capital_deploy` workflow or a direct Signal Architect quote.

---

### `get_capital_efficiency` (Pioneer)

A single 0–100 score summarizing how productively the wagon is working.

**Formula (transparent):**

```
score = 100
       − 30 × (idleStablesUSD / totalUSD)        // dust drag
       − 20 × max(0, concentrationTop1 − 0.40)   // over-concentration
       − 15 × max(0, dryProtocolsCount × 0.05)   // positions in cooled protocols
       − 10 × max(0, ageBeyond90DaysShare)       // staleness
       + 25 × (yieldEarningShare)                // capital actually earning
```

**Returns:**

```
{
  "score": 72,
  "breakdown": {
    "earning": 0.62,
    "idle": 0.15,
    "suboptimal": 0.23
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Move 1240 idle USDC on Arbitrum into a Pioneer-grade lending pool.",
    "Top-1 concentration is 49.7% — diversify before adding.",
    "Aerodrome LP is trending below median; consider reducing 20%."
  ]
}
```

**Agent posture:** If the score is below 50, lead with capital efficiency in the briefing. If above 80, only mention if the user asks. Never editorialize the score — quote it neutrally.

---

### `get_rebalance_plan` (Pioneer)

Given a target allocation, produce a swap list to reach it.

**Inputs:**

```
{
  "walletAddress": "0x…",
  "targetAllocation": [
    { "asset": "ETH", "percent": 40 },
    { "asset": "USDC", "percent": 30 },
    { "asset": "weETH", "percent": 20 },
    { "asset": "SOL", "percent": 10 }
  ],
  "constraints": { "maxSwaps": 6, "maxSlippagePct": 0.5 }
}
```

**Returns:**

```
{
  "proposedSwaps": [
    {
      "from": { "asset": "USDC", "chain": "arbitrum", "amountUSD": 800 },
      "to":   { "asset": "ETH",  "chain": "arbitrum" },
      "reason": "Under-weight ETH by 5% relative to target."
    },
    ...
  ],
  "expectedFeeUSD": 18.40,
  "expectedSlippageUSD": 4.20,
  "netDriftClosedPct": 9.4
}
```

**Agent posture:** Present the plan as a *discussion*, not a directive. Hand off to Signal Architect for execution; never call `execute_swap` from Wagon Steward.

---

### `watch_wagon` (Syndicate)

Subscribe to portfolio-drift, idle-capital, and position-health events.

**Inputs:**

```
{
  "walletAddress": "0x…",
  "alertWebhook": "https://your-agent.example.com/webhook",
  "thresholds": {
    "concentrationTop1": 0.50,
    "idleCapitalUSD": 2000,
    "drawdown7dPct": 5
  }
}
```

**Returns:** A `watchId` and the active threshold set. Cron evaluates every 15 min and emits events of type `wagon.event.*` on breach.

---

## Cross-Skill Composition

Wagon Steward is designed to compose with the other FarmDash skills. The standard composition pattern:

```
Trail Intelligence  →  Wagon Steward  →  Signal Architect / Futures Strategist
   "what's hot"        "what I have"       "make it happen"
```

| Companion skill | When to call it | Hand-off pattern |
|---|---|---|
| **Trail Intelligence** | Before recommending any new entry — confirm the protocol is still hot | TI returns Trail Heat + risk → WS confirms feasibility against current balances |
| **Trail Marshal** | When the user wants the whole sequence orchestrated | TM calls WS first to ground the plan in real balances, then calls SA/FS to execute |
| **Signal Architect** | When the rebalance plan needs to actually move tokens | WS produces the plan, SA quotes + executes each swap with user confirmation |
| **Futures Strategist** | When the user wants to hedge the wagon's spot exposure | WS provides spot exposure context, FS sizes a delta-neutral perp |

**Important:** Wagon Steward never auto-calls another skill. It produces analysis; the user (or an orchestrator like Trail Marshal) decides what to do with it.

---

## Output Format Standards

Every Wagon Steward response includes:

| Field | Always present | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `asOf` | Yes | DeFi changes fast; agents must time-bound analysis |
| `walletAddress` | Yes | Echo the wallet so the agent never confuses contexts |
| `tier` | Yes | Tells the agent if it should ask for an upgrade |
| `confidence` | When derived | 0–1; lower when one chain is rate-limited or stale |
| `staleAfterMs` | Yes | Caching hint for orchestrators |

---

## Risk Warnings the Agent Must Surface

For any portfolio recommendation the agent should restate that:

- Balances are read at a moment in time; mempool activity may shift them within minutes
- Cross-chain holdings may include unverified tokens — Wagon Steward only scores tokens it can price
- Rebalance plans assume current liquidity; real execution may have higher slippage on volatile pairs
- Capital efficiency is a heuristic, not financial advice
- The user is solely responsible for the final decision

---

## Autonomous Portfolio Intelligence Upgrade (v0.6)

Every Wagon-aware agent loop should maintain a portfolio state ledger. This makes the agent useful across sessions without granting it execution authority.

```json
{
  "walletAddress": "0x...",
  "asOf": "timestamp from FarmDash or normalized by agent",
  "portfolioState": {
    "totalValueUsd": 0,
    "nativeBalanceUsd": 0,
    "idleCapitalUsd": 0,
    "chainDistribution": {},
    "topConcentrationPct": 0,
    "unpricedAssetsCount": 0
  },
  "riskState": {
    "overConcentrated": false,
    "idleDrag": false,
    "staleData": false,
    "routeNeeded": false
  },
  "nextBestAction": "hold | monitor | research | quote_swap | reduce | rebalance",
  "handoff": "none | trail_intelligence | trail_marshal | signal_architect | futures_strategist"
}
```

Decision rules:

- If any chain or token data is missing, say what is missing and lower confidence; never zero missing balances.
- If idle capital is present but Trail Intelligence has no high-quality destination, recommend `monitor`, not forced deployment.
- If top concentration is above 40%, discuss risk before adding more exposure to that same asset or chain.
- If a rebalance requires swaps, return a plan and hand off to Signal Architect for quotes and signatures.
- If spot exposure needs a hedge, pass the asset, notional size, and risk concern to Futures Strategist; do not size perps from this skill alone.

## Recommended Workflows

### Workflow 1: "Wagon Briefing"

```
1. get_portfolio_summary           → totals + top positions
2. get_capital_efficiency          → single score with breakdown
3. get_idle_capital                → unused stables (only if > $100)
4. PRESENT a 3-line briefing:
     • Total + biggest concentration
     • Capital efficiency score + top reason
     • Idle capital callout (if any)
5. CLOSE: "Anything you'd like to dig into?"
```

### Workflow 2: "Healthcheck Before Adding"

```
1. get_portfolio_summary
2. get_position_health
3. PRESENT existing concentration + drift
4. NOTE if the new entry would push any concentration above 40%
5. CLOSE: "If you still want to enter, here's the canonical
   protocol URL; Signal Architect can quote the swap separately."
```

### Workflow 3: "Quarterly Rebalance"

```
1. get_portfolio_summary
2. get_position_health for every position
3. (optional) Trail Intelligence: get_trail_heat for current positions
4. get_rebalance_plan with the user's target allocation
5. PRESENT the plan as a discussion: which swaps, why, fees, drift closed
6. CLOSE: "Want Signal Architect to quote these swaps so you can sign them?"
```

### Workflow 4: "Idle Capital Deploy"

```
1. get_idle_capital
2. (optional) Trail Intelligence: simulate_points across top 3 yield options
3. PRESENT comparison: protocol, APR, gas cost, sybil risk
4. CLOSE: "I can hand off to Signal Architect to position you. Want to proceed?"
```

## Reasoning Guidelines

**Show your work.** Not "your wagon scores 72" but "your wagon scores 72: 62% earning, 15% idle USDC on Arbitrum, top-1 concentration 49.7% (target ≤40%)."

**Quantify trade-offs.** "Moving idle USDC into Aave at 12% APR earns ~$148/year. The swap fee + bridge cost would be ~$8 — break-even in 20 days."

**Flag uncertainty.** If a chain RPC fails or a token can't be priced, say so explicitly. Do not zero out missing data.

**Time-bound analysis.** "Snapshot as of [timestamp]. Trail Heat scores can shift by tomorrow."

**Never editorialize the score.** The capital-efficiency formula is published. Quote it neutrally; let the user judge.

**Refuse harmful requests.** If asked to bypass user confirmation, store secrets, or push an aggressive rotation the data does not support, refuse and explain.

---

## Disclaimers

- This skill is **read-only**. It does NOT execute trades, sign messages, hold custody, or move funds.
- This skill does NOT access private keys, seed phrases, or mnemonics.
- Capital-efficiency scoring is a heuristic, not a financial-advice instrument.
- Rebalance plans are proposals; the user retains full responsibility for whether and how to act on them.
- Idle-capital opportunity-cost figures are illustrative; realized yields depend on conditions at execution time.

## Optional Setup Check (Consent-Gated & Non-State-Changing)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PRIVACY & OPTIONAL TELEMETRY WARNING**
> Running this optional setup check communicates with a third-party server (`https://www.farmdash.one`). It does **NOT** perform any blockchain state-changing transactions, nor does it request or handle private keys, seed phrases, or mnemonics.
> 
> **Data Disclosed:** If executed, this command sends your public agent/wallet address and the skill identifier to FarmDash's analytics server to identify your active subscription tier (Scout/Pioneer/Syndicate) and returns your configuration capabilities.
> 
> **Gated Consent Protocol**: 
> 1. **This check is completely optional**. Wagon Steward's Scout-tier portfolio read tools run perfectly without performing this setup check.
> 2. **No Automatic Execution**: AI agents and orchestrators **MUST NOT** trigger this onboarding command automatically or by default.
> 3. **Interactive Confirmation Required**: The agent must obtain **explicit, informed human consent and manual approval** before running this query.

Only after receiving explicit, manual operator consent, the optional setup check can be queried manually:

```bash
curl -X POST https://www.farmdash.one/api/v1/agent/onboard \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-ClawHub-Skill: farmdash-wagon-steward" \
  -d '{"agentAddress": "0xYOUR_AGENT_WALLET"}'
```

### What this optional query does:
- **Retrieves Configuration**: Returns your current tier access (Scout/Pioneer/Syndicate) and active tool definitions.
- **Validates API Tier Limits**: Connects your ClawHub session to the corresponding subscription limits for portfolio reading.
- **Analytics Registration**: Registers your public agent wallet address in the FarmDash service funnel solely for capacity planning and active session telemetry.

### Next steps after manual check:
1. **GET** `/api/v1/agent/onboard` — Full capability map and setup guide.
2. **Upgrade** to Pioneer ($39.99/mo) or Syndicate ($199/mo) for execution access.
3. **Browse** the OpenAPI spec at `https://www.farmdash.one/agents/openapi.yaml`.
