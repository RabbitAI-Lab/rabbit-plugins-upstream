# Going live

Test mode is a separate sandbox. To ask real people, the user connects their own Instant Expert account through the MCP server at `https://instant.expert/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, OAuth 2.1 sign-in, no API key). Nothing from test mode carries over.

## 1. Connect the server

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http --scope user instant-expert https://instant.expert/mcp
```

Then run `/mcp`, pick `instant-expert` and choose **Authenticate**. Claude Code opens the sign-in page in the browser. New tools appear after the sign-in; if they don't, restart Claude Code.

### OpenClaw

OpenClaw connects to remote MCP servers natively ([docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/cli/mcp/transports)). Save the server with OAuth, then sign in:

```bash
openclaw mcp set instant-expert '{"url":"https://instant.expert/mcp","transport":"streamable-http","auth":"oauth","oauth":{"scope":"email profile"}}'
openclaw mcp login instant-expert
openclaw mcp doctor instant-expert --probe
```

`openclaw mcp login` prints a sign-in link; the user opens it, signs in to Instant Expert and approves. Keep the scope to `email profile`: Instant Expert refuses `openid`. With Gateway hot reload on, the tools appear on the next turn; otherwise restart the Gateway.

### Claude (claude.ai and Claude Desktop), Cursor, VS Code, Codex and others

Follow https://instant.expert/docs/mcp#connect. Codex needs `scopes = ["email", "profile"]` in its config, because Instant Expert refuses the `openid` scope.

## 2. Sign in and allow sending

The user signs in on instant.expert and approves the connection. A new connection can search, import, draft and read replies. To let the agent place orders, the user also:

1. ticks **Allow paid requests from this assistant** on the consent screen, or turns it on later at https://instant.expert/settings/connections, and
2. adds a card at https://instant.expert/settings/requesting?tab=account. Saving a card charges nothing. Card details never go through chat.

Without paid sending, the agent prepares drafts and the user sends them from https://instant.expert/requests.

## 3. Use the live tools

Run the same flow as in test mode. Two differences:

- Real people take hours to days to answer. Check `list_requests` or `get_request` when the user asks, or on a schedule, instead of polling in a loop.
- `prepare_request_order` may return `status: "action_required"` with `blockers` and an `action_url`. Give the user `next_step` as written: one visit to that link fixes a missing card, the paid-sending permission and empty booking hours. Then call `prepare_request_order` again and show the new preview.

| Blocker | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `send_permission_required` | Paid sending is off for this connection |
| `payment_method_required` | No saved card |
| `availability_required` | A call needs booking hours and the saved ones are empty |
| `select_saved_card` | Several cards and no default: ask which one, then pass its `payment_method_reference` |
| `spending_cap_required` | Pass `max_spend_cents` to `prepare_request_order` |

If the bank asks for verification, `send_requests` returns `payment_action_required` with a `review_url`; the user finishes there and nothing is sent until then.
