# Monitor a TikTok Genre / Scene

Stand up a recurring TikTok genre monitor and read its discovery signals: trending sounds, hashtag momentum, rising creators, and genre benchmarks. A "genre" is just a recurring agent (`POST /v1/agents` with `is_recurring: true`) with `platforms: ["tiktok"]` and genre keywords.

## User Prompt

"Track the progressive house scene on TikTok — what sounds and hashtags are blowing up, and which small creators are breaking out?"

## Agent Steps

1. Create the genre monitor. Use 3-7 specific multi-word keywords that all describe the SAME genre (synonyms/sub-scenes). Hashtag-style tokens are fine — `#progressivehouse` and `progressive house` resolve to the same keyword.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.virlo.ai/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIRLO_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "is_recurring": true,
    "intent": "track the progressive house scene on TikTok — breakout sounds, hashtags, and small creators",
    "name": "Progressive House Scene",
    "keywords": ["progressive house", "#melodichouse", "melodic techno", "afterhours set", "organic house"],
    "platforms": ["tiktok"],
    "cadence": "weekly"
  }'
```

2. The first run queues immediately. Poll every ~60s until `finalized: true` (~15-20 min) — don't loop tightly:

```bash
curl "https://api.virlo.ai/v1/agents/{id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIRLO_API_KEY"
```

3. Read the discovery signals (all free):

```bash
# Sounds breaking out in the genre right now (momentum, not all-time)
curl "https://api.virlo.ai/v1/agents/{id}/sounds?sort=rising&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIRLO_API_KEY"

# Hashtags gaining steam + the creators driving each
curl "https://api.virlo.ai/v1/agents/{id}/hashtags?sort=growth&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIRLO_API_KEY"

# Rising creators, filtered to a seeding-friendly follower tier
curl "https://api.virlo.ai/v1/agents/{id}/creators/outliers?order_by=rising&follower_tier=micro" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIRLO_API_KEY"

# Genre norms — what "good" looks like per follower tier
curl "https://api.virlo.ai/v1/agents/{id}/benchmarks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIRLO_API_KEY"

# Adjacent scenes to expand into (exploratory, beta)
curl "https://api.virlo.ai/v1/agents/{id}/affinity" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIRLO_API_KEY"
```

4. (Optional) Catch a sound before it peaks across all of TikTok, and resolve a standout sound back to its real artist (for licensing / outreach):

```bash
# Platform-wide breakout sounds (early-momentum detector)
curl "https://api.virlo.ai/v1/sounds/breakout" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIRLO_API_KEY"

# Resolve a specific sound to its canonical artist
curl -G "https://api.virlo.ai/v1/sounds/{sound_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VIRLO_API_KEY" \
  -d resolve=true
```

5. Summarize: the sound to ride this week, the hashtags heating up, the rising micro-creators to seed/collab with (and how they compare to the genre norm), and confirm the weekly monitor will keep this fresh — and self-optimize as it learns the scene.

## Total Cost

Free to create the monitor; each weekly run is billed like a search ($0.50/run). Every discovery read above is free. `/v1/sounds/breakout` is $0.25; `?resolve=true` on a sound adds $0.10 only the first time that sound is resolved.

> **Legacy note:** the old `POST /v1/comet` + `/v1/comet/:id/…` reads still work but are deprecated (removed Aug 3, 2026).
