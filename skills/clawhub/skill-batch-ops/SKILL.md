# Skill Batch Operations

Purpose: run the same operation across N skills without repeating known platform traps N times. Division of labor: skill-audit-publish owns single-skill governance; this skill owns repetition, ordering, and rate-limit choreography.

## Workflow

1. [Deterministic] **Inventory**: build the target list first (slug, local path, local version, platform latest per platform). Never publish blind from memory — always query platform latest before choosing version numbers.
2. [Deterministic] **Version decision**: unified version across all platforms = max(existing platform latests) + 0.0.1. Check ClawHub with `inspect <slug> --versions` (platform Latest can lead the version field inside the file — phantom occupation). Check SkillHub via its API. Check GitHub via the repo frontmatter.
3. [Deterministic] **Batch patch**: apply file changes via scripts written with the file-write tool. NEVER pass multi-line content through shell heredocs or `python -c` string arguments — newlines get corrupted into literal `/n`. Each patched skill gets frontmatter validated: leading `---`, slug, displayName, version, and quoting on the version value.
4. [Deterministic] **Publish ClawHub** per skill with explicit parameters: `--slug`, `--name`, `--version`, `--changelog`, using `C:/` style paths. Remove any platform-generated files (e.g. skill-card.md) from the source directory first. "Version already exists" = phantom occupation → bump and retry.
5. [Deterministic] **Publish SkillHub** per skill, ≥60s between publishes (429 rate limit). Frontmatter must be complete: leading `---`, slug, displayName, version. Downloaded-from-ClawHub files usually need these backfilled.
6. [Deterministic] **Sync GitHub** from the FINAL published source directory (the one with final version numbers), never from install/download directories which may hold stale content. Contents API upserts only — it never deletes removed files.
7. [Deterministic] **Verify**: install each skill back from the platform; diff installed SKILL.md against the published source; confirm version fields match. Record per-item status.

8. [LLM] **Freshness pass**: skills unchanged for over four weeks on the primary platform get a real micro-improvement bump (scan staleness -> pull lead package as baseline -> edit -> publish -> write back the local mother). Never an empty version bump.

## Platform Restriction Checklist

| Platform | Trap | Countermeasure |
|---|---|---|
| ClawHub | version phantom occupation | `inspect --versions`, target Latest + 0.0.1 |
| ClawHub | platform-generated files in install dirs | delete before publish |
| ClawHub | unquoted version rejected | quote in frontmatter + explicit `--version` |
| SkillHub | strict frontmatter validation | leading `---`, slug, displayName, version |
| SkillHub | 429 on consecutive publishes | ≥60s interval |
| SkillHub | tombstoned (deleted) skill blocks slug republish — `publish` returns 409 "slug 冲突: skill already exists" even for the owner; the record still shows in dashboard but 404s on public API (`/api/v1/skills/{slug}` + `/api/v1/download`) | no CLI/API undelete found (as of 2026-09-08); restore via web console (个人中心 → 我的 Skill), then CLI publish upserts normally; never probe DELETE to confirm tombstone state on a possibly-alive skill — use the public-detail 404 + publish 409 pattern instead |
| SkillHub | publish of an ALIVE existing skill = same endpoint, upserts; response `skillId=<old id> status=None`, and `latestVersion` in API only updates after review queue clears | after publish, check `latestVersion` later; do not misread it as failure |
| SkillHub | working publish channel = `POST https://api.skillhub.cn/api/v1/community/skills/publish`, Bearer token from `~/.skillhub/credentials.json`, multipart: `payload` (JSON: slug/displayName/version/summary/summaryZh/changelog/tags) + `files` parts (filename = relative path). The clawhub-CLI-with-swapped-registry route does NOT work (skillhub has no `/whoami` or `/publish/token/mint`); direct POST to `/api/v1/skills` 401s (publish route only accepts minted clawhub tokens) | use the community endpoint via script; no skillhub CLI exists |
| SkillHub | transient `503 Service Temporarily Unavailable` (stgw edge) can hit publish or GET mid-batch | retry the same request after ~20s (verified self-heals); do not re-derive versions or rebuild staging |
| GitHub | connector cannot create personal repos | PAT from credential file, REST API |
| GitHub | contents API never deletes | full re-push from pub source; note stale files |
| GitHub | dot-directories get pushed and may contain private content (`.local/`, `.clawhub/`) | exclude dot-directories in the walk before pushing; if already pushed, DELETE via contents API and verify raw 404 |
| All | `\n` corruption in shell args | multi-line content only via written script files |

## Hard Rules

- Per-item verification is never skipped, even when the batch is large.
- Explicit publish parameters always; no reliance on frontmatter defaults for version-critical fields.
- One failure is logged and the batch continues; systemic failure (auth, network) halts the batch immediately.
- GitHub sync source = final published directory, never an install/download directory.

## Failure Handling

- Item fails on one platform: log with the platform error text, continue the rest, include in the final failure table.
- Same item fails twice on the same platform: stop touching that item, mark MANUAL, move on.
- Auth errors: verify the credential source file was actually read and the value actually exported to the subprocess before suspecting the credential itself.

## Output Format

Final batch table: skill | ClawHub version + result | SkillHub version + result | GitHub result | verify status. Followed by a failure list (empty = clean run) and the unified version number used.
