## Publisher:

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Ozon sellers and analysts use this skill to find third-level categories beneath a known second-level category and obtain the typeId needed for subsequent category queries.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Automatic installation or upgrade of qhkit and Node may change the host environment.

Mitigation: Review installation commands before execution; prefer a preinstalled, pinned qhkit version.

Risk: Configuring the Qinghu service token or modifying a shell profile may expose credentials or alter future sessions.

Mitigation: Prefer an ephemeral QHKIT_TOKEN and review any qhkit config set or shell profile change before allowing it.

Risk: Category lookups can incur Qinghu credit charges.

Mitigation: Check the estimate and obtain user consent before paid calls; report actual credits consumed.
