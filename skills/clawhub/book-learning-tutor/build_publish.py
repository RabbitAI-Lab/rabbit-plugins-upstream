"""
Build a clean ClawHub publish bundle from the Book Learning Tutor repo.

What it does
------------
Reads `git ls-files -z` from the source repo (raw UTF-8, no shell quoting), so
it always mirrors exactly what "Import from GitHub" would pull -- automatically
excludes .gitignore'd dirs like venv_slim/, 书库/, 参考/, data/, _backup_/, etc.
Then copies every tracked file into the publish folder EXCEPT a small blocklist
of repo-only artifacts that must not ship inside an installed skill:

  .github/   CI workflows (not part of the installed skill)
  tests/     dev-only tests + fixtures
  LICENSE    ClawHub forces MIT-0 and rejects a bundled LICENSE
  .gitignore repo-internal; irrelevant inside an installed skill

Run whenever you bump the repo and want to re-publish:
  python build_publish.py
then publish the publish/ folder (folder upload or `clawhub skill publish ./`).

NOTE: the repo's safe-delete hook blocks agent-side deletion, so this script
overwrites in place instead of wiping. If a file is later REMOVED from tracking
its stale copy may linger in publish/ -- delete the publish/ folder manually
(Explorer / rm -rf) for a full reset.
