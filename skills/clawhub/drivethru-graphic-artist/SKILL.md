# Drivethru Graphic Artist — Product Mockups

Take a **blank** product photo plus a **decoration** image and return a
composite **mockup**. Compositing is deterministic image manipulation: Pillow
for transform/compose, [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) (U²-Net
segmentation — *not* generative) for background removal and garment bbox
detection.

**No pixels are ever model-generated.** The compositing pipeline never invokes
a generative model — only fall back to an image model to *create* artwork if
the user *explicitly* asks (e.g. "generate a new logo"), and say so first.

**But you must review your own output.** After composing, you (the model
running this skill) `Read` the rendered PNG, judge the placement, and
re-compose with corrective deltas if it's off — up to 3 attempts — before
returning it. This is judgment, not generation: it only tunes the same numeric
flags a human would. See [Self-review loop](#self-review-loop-required) below.

## The three inputs

1. **Blank** — photo of the product (t-shirt, hoodie, hat, mug, …). Any
   resolution or crop; the garment's bounding box is detected automatically.
2. **Decoration** — the logo/graphic to place. PNG with transparency is ideal.
   For an opaque image, pre-clean it first: a **flat logo on a solid color**
   should go through `knockout_color.py` (crisp edges, no halo — see
   [Background removal](#background-removal-flat-art-vs-photos)); `--auto-remove-bg`
   runs rembg inline and is meant for a *photographic* decoration, not flat art.
3. **Placement** — where it goes: `full_front`, `left_chest`, `right_chest`,
   `full_back`, `back_yoke`, `sleeve`, `front`, …

**Category** (hoodie / tee / hat / mug / …) is helpful but optional. If the
user doesn't say, infer it from the image or chat, or omit it to fall back to
the `_defaults` rules.

## How placement works

Placement rules are **ratios against the detected garment bounding box**, not
absolute pixels or inches, so a youth tee and an adult tee get visually
matching prints. Each rule has `width_ratio`, `x_center_ratio`, `y_top_ratio`,
`rotation_deg`, and an optional `max_height_ratio` (caps print height to fit a
location's height box — e.g. a hoodie full-front print must clear the pocket).
Look-up order: `(category, placement)` → `(_defaults, placement)` → error.

The shipped ratios are reconciled to real industry print dimensions — see
[`references/decoration_spec.md`](references/decoration_spec.md) (with the
canonical placement diagram at `assets/decoration_guide.png`). That's the
ground truth the self-review loop judges against: a chest logo is pocket-sized
(~¼ the width of a full front), a full back equals a full front, etc.

The catalog ships with the skill at `assets/placement_rules.json` (read-only
starter). When the agent adds or refines rules, an editable copy is created in
the data dir (`$MOCKUP_DATA_DIR` or `~/.drivethru/mockup`) and persists there.
See [`references/placement_rules_schema.json`](references/placement_rules_schema.json)
for the exact schema.

## Requirements

- `python3`, plus `uv` on PATH (used to self-bootstrap dependencies).
- **Dependencies install themselves — you never have to `pip install` by hand.**
  Each script ensures its own imports at startup: if `Pillow`/`numpy`/`rembg`
  aren't already importable, it builds a cached venv in the data dir
  (`$MOCKUP_DATA_DIR/.venv`, default `~/.drivethru/mockup/.venv`) with `uv` and
  re-execs into it. Hosts that honor the frontmatter `install.uv` pre-install
  everything and the bootstrap is a no-op; otherwise the first run pays a short
  one-time install. See [`scripts/_bootstrap.py`](scripts/_bootstrap.py).
- Three dependency tiers, so the common flat-art path stays cheap:
  - **light** — `Pillow` + `numpy`. Everything except segmentation and cleanup
    (`knockout_color.py`, `prepare_dtf_production.py`, `extract_colors.py`).
    Installs in ~2 s, no model download.
  - **cleanup** — adds `scipy` + `opencv-python-headless` (a few tens of MB of
    wheels, **no** model download). Only `cleanup_art.py` pulls it in — scipy for
    the despeckle/close morphology, headless OpenCV for the corner-preserving
    vector trace. Works fully offline. (`--method raster` skips OpenCV and needs
    only scipy.)
  - **heavy** — adds `rembg` + `onnxruntime` (~170 MB of wheels **plus** a
    one-time ~170 MB `u2net` model download on first segmentation). Only
    `remove_background.py`, `detect_garment_bbox.py`, and `compose_mockup.py`
    pull it in. The model download needs outbound network once; if it's blocked,
    bbox detection falls back to the full image frame and `--auto-remove-bg`
    errors — but the color-key path (`knockout_color.py`) still works offline.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/compose_mockup.py` | The workhorse: detect bbox, look up rule, scale/rotate/paste, write PNG, print a JSON receipt. |
| `scripts/detect_garment_bbox.py` | Standalone: print the garment bbox JSON for a blank. |
| `scripts/knockout_color.py` | **Flat art:** key a solid background *color* out (logos/line art/decals) → RGBA PNG with clean anti-aliased edges. Color-to-alpha or flood (die-cut); `--analyze` first to see what each mode removes and get a color-list-backed recommendation. The right tool for a logo on a plate — see [Background removal](#background-removal-flat-art-vs-photos). |
| `scripts/remove_background.py` | **Photos:** run rembg (U²-Net segmentation) on a *photographic* subject → RGBA PNG. Wrong tool for flat logos — use `knockout_color.py` for those. |
| `scripts/thumbnail_card.py` | Composite art/cutout onto a neutral gray or checker card → a legible **thumbnail** for the DB `image` field (white art stops vanishing). Human-facing only; never the production file. Optional. |
| `scripts/edit_placement_rule.py` | Schema-validated, atomic mutator for `placement_rules.json` (`show` / `add` / `update` / `remove`). |
| `scripts/cleanup_art.py` | **Fix degraded / AI-generated flat art** (before a drop): snap it to its true inks, rebuild faded/broken/jagged outlines, re-render crisp at print size (corner-preserving vector trace, or `--method raster`). Deterministic — no model-generated pixels. Writes a `*_proof.png` (before/after + outline zoom) to `Read` and self-review. See [`references/production_cleanup.md`](references/production_cleanup.md). |
| `scripts/prepare_dtf_production.py` | Production-ready: fit the real art (aspect-locked) into a location's print box and stamp it at 300 DPI → print-ready PNG + inch/pixel receipt. |
| `scripts/extract_colors.py` | Production-ready: extract dominant colors from art as `#RRGGBB` + coverage (feeds `decoration_match_colors`). |
| `scripts/upload_production_file.py` | Production-ready: POST a local production file to Odoo's `/drivethru_mcp/v1/upload` route — server-side base64, no chunking, keeps the (large) file out of your token stream. Preferred for a real 300 DPI file **when `ODOO_MCP_URL` + `ODOO_MCP_TOKEN` are set**; when they're absent, stream the file through the `decoration_set_image` MCP tool instead. Same 20 MB server guard either way. |

## Composing a mockup

```bash
python3 scripts/compose_mockup.py \
    --blank /path/to/blank.jpg \
    --decoration /path/to/logo.png \
    --category hoodie \
    --placement full_front \
    [--auto-remove-bg] \
    [--width-delta-pct 0] [--offset-x-pct 0] [--offset-y-pct 0] \
    [--rotate-deg 0] \
    [--output /path/to/out.png]
```

The script prints JSON with the detected `garment_bbox`, the resolved `rule`,
the `applied` ratios/deltas, and the `output` path. Return the PNG to the user
and add one line in human terms ("55% of the garment width, centered on the
chest, no rotation").

Defaults: rules come from the editable data-dir copy if present, else the
bundled starter; output goes to `<data dir>/out/<uuid>.png`. Override with
`--rules` / `--output`.

## Self-review loop (required)

The ratio rules are a *starting guess*. For a given garment/decoration pair
they can land the print too high, too small, or off-center — and the
deterministic pipeline can't notice, because it has no eyes. You do. **Do not
return the first compose unseen.**

After every compose, run this loop before handing anything to the user:

1. **Compose** with the current flags; note the `output` path from the receipt.
2. **`Read` the output PNG** — actually look at the rendered mockup.
3. **Judge** it against what the placement should look like (centered on the
   chest for `full_front`, small over the pec for `left_chest`, etc.).
4. If it looks good → return it. If it's off and you have attempts left →
   derive corrective deltas and re-compose, **layering them on the previous
   run's flags** (same deltas as the iterative-feedback table: e.g. print
   riding too high → `--offset-y-pct +8`; too small → `--width-delta-pct +12`).
5. **Hard cap: 3 compose attempts.** If attempt 3 still isn't great, return the
   best one and tell the user in one line what's still off and offer to keep
   tuning. Never loop past 3, and never ping-pong a delta's sign — if you
   overshoot, you're close; accept the better result.

The full review checklist (per-placement targets, critique→delta mapping,
oscillation/no-progress guards, what to tell the user) is in
[`references/self_review.md`](references/self_review.md), and the targets there
are anchored to real print dimensions in
[`references/decoration_spec.md`](references/decoration_spec.md). This runs
entirely in-container — you are the reviewer; there is no separate model call.

## Iterative feedback

Mockups are a back-and-forth. When the user says "bigger", "move it up",
"rotate it", layer deltas on top of the **previous** run's args (e.g.
`--width-delta-pct +10`, `--offset-y-pct -5`, `--rotate-deg 5`). Keep a running
record of the current flags so each turn builds on the last. The full
feedback→flags mapping and how to promote a tuned result into a saved default
are in [`references/iterative_feedback.md`](references/iterative_feedback.md).

## Cleaning up degraded / AI-generated art

Some art that comes in isn't clean vector — it's **"fake vector":** a logo an
image model generated (or someone upscaled from a tiny JPEG) that *looks* crisp
at thumbnail size but is a soft raster full of **ghosting, desaturated haze,
faded/broken outlines, jagged uneven strokes, and blurry edges.** You don't see
it in the DB thumbnail; it's glaring once it prints at **13″**. Catching and
fixing that is part of "dropping for production."

**The move is to restore, not regenerate.** A human artist wouldn't salvage the
blurry pixels or feed it to an image generator (which would rewrite the
letterforms and text) — they'd rebuild it as the few flat inks it was always
meant to be. `scripts/cleanup_art.py` does exactly that, **deterministically (no
model-generated pixels):** snap every pixel to its true ink (dropping the
haze/ghost), despeckle + close each ink mask to rejoin broken outlines, and
re-render each mask crisp at print size with a **corner-preserving vector trace**
(smooths the jaggies/waviness without rounding letter corners).

```bash
python3 scripts/cleanup_art.py --input /tmp/thumb.png \
    --inks '#26296B,#A0202C,#FFFFFF' \     # decoration colors[].rgb_hex (best source)
    --output /tmp/thumb_clean.png
```

It writes the cleaned PNG **plus a `*_proof.png`** (before/after on gray + dark,
and a zoom on the outline detail where defects hide) and a JSON receipt with a
`review_checklist`. **`Read` the proof and self-review it** — outlines crisp and
uniform? corners still sharp? letterforms unchanged? ghost/haze gone? — then tune
and re-run if needed. Same eyes-on discipline as the mockup
[self-review](references/self_review.md); the customer sees the reviewed result.

This restores *intent*, it doesn't redesign: it keeps intended style (e.g. hollow
outline letters stay hollow), preserves counters, and **can't invent a mark
that's genuinely missing** (only faded/broken ones) — flag those for a redraw.
Full procedure, the defect-recognition guide, tuning table, and the
faithful-vs-restyle line: **[`references/production_cleanup.md`](references/production_cleanup.md).**

## Making art production-ready (DTF) — "dropping" the art

Separate from mockups: when the user gives you a **decoration id** and asks to
make it **production-ready** / **drop the art** / **get it to done**, you take the
decoration's real thumbnail, size it to its location, render it at **300 DPI**,
upload the DTF production file, set the actual size + colors, and create a print
sample — driving the record toward the `done` state. **First inspect the art at
production scale** — if it's degraded / AI-generated (ghosting, haze, faded or
jagged outlines), clean it up with `cleanup_art.py`
([above](#cleaning-up-degraded--ai-generated-art)) *before* sizing it. This is deterministic image
work (the same *no model-generated pixels* rule applies) and almost always
applies to decorations whose method is **DTF**.

You drive it through the `drivethru_mcp` **`decoration_*`** MCP tools
(`decoration_get_production_readiness` → `decoration_get_image` →
`decoration_set_image` → `decoration_update_fields` → `decoration_match_colors` →
`decoration_create_sample` → `decoration_set_state`) plus the two scripts
`prepare_dtf_production.py` and `extract_colors.py`.

> **How to call these:** the `decoration_*` tools are MCP tools your host
> already exposes — invoke each one **directly as a tool call**, like any other
> tool available to you. Do **not** hand-roll an HTTP request to the Odoo host to
> *invoke* a tool, and do **not** go hunting for an `ODOO_MCP_URL` / `ODOO_MCP_TOKEN`
> to POST against for that: there is **no `/call` REST route**, so a 404 there
> means you invented a URL, not that the MCP is down.
>
> Raw HTTP has exactly **two** legitimate uses here — both for moving image
> *bytes* out of your token stream, never for invoking a tool: **downloading** a
> `cdn_url` that `decoration_get_image` returns for a large/offloaded binary
> (step 2), and **uploading** a real production file with `upload_production_file.py`
> (step 5, when `ODOO_MCP_URL` / `ODOO_MCP_TOKEN` are set). Everything else is a
> tool call.

Start with `decoration_get_production_readiness` — it returns a `blocking_gaps`
list mirroring Odoo's own `done` gate (production file, size, colors, sample,
and a completed linked design). Per-location max print sizes come from the Odoo
`decoration_location` record, with [`references/location_dimensions.json`](references/location_dimensions.json)
(built from the official spec sheet, `references/decoration_spec_sheet.pdf`) as
the fallback.

Note: a decoration can't actually reach `done` without a linked `design` in the
`done` state — expect that gap to remain and report it, after completing every
other step and creating the ready sample.

**Full step-by-step procedure: [`references/production_ready.md`](references/production_ready.md).**

## Editing the rules catalog

Show the current catalog:

```bash
python3 scripts/edit_placement_rule.py show [--category hoodie] [--placement full_front]
```

Add a new category/placement when one is missing:

```bash
python3 scripts/edit_placement_rule.py add tote front \
    --width-ratio 0.45 --x-center-ratio 0.50 --y-top-ratio 0.30
```

Refine an existing default (e.g. after the user approves a tuned result):

```bash
python3 scripts/edit_placement_rule.py update hoodie full_front --width-ratio 0.58
```

Edits are validated and written atomically to the editable copy in the data dir
(seeded from the bundled starter on first edit) — the shipped asset is never
mutated.

## Background removal: flat art vs photos

There are **two** background removers here because they solve different problems.
Pick by what the source *is*, not by habit:

| The source is… | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Flat art** on a solid color — a logo, line art, a decal, a DTF thumbnail on a white plate | `knockout_color.py` | Keys on the actual color, so edges stay crisp and there's no halo |
| **A photographic subject** — a real object/garment/person to isolate from a busy scene | `remove_background.py` (rembg) | U²-Net segmentation finds the salient subject a color key can't |

**Do not use rembg (`remove_background.py`) on a flat logo.** rembg is a
salient-object segmentation model built for photos; on flat art it produces a
soft matte that leaves a light **halo**, and it has no notion of "make *this*
color transparent," so it can't cleanly knock out a white plate.

### Knocking a color out of flat art

```bash
python3 scripts/knockout_color.py --input /tmp/logo.jpg --output /tmp/logo.png \
    [--mode color-to-alpha|flood] [--color auto|'#RRGGBB'] [--fuzz 0.10] [--feather 2]
```

The key color defaults to `auto` (median of the four corners). Two modes:

- **`color-to-alpha`** (default) — remove the key color **everywhere**, with
  clean anti-aliased edges. Each pixel's alpha becomes proportional to its
  distance from the key color and the foreground color is un-multiplied back
  out, so a gray edge pixel becomes *semi-transparent black* instead of an
  opaque gray rim. Best for one-color line art you want printed as ink on the
  garment (the garment shows through letter counters and open areas).
- **`flood`** — remove only the background **connected to the border** (a
  tolerant flood fill, feathered at the edge). Enclosed regions of the key color
  are **kept** — a white field inside an outline stays white. This is the
  "die-cut sticker" look.

#### Which mode? Decide it, don't guess it

The choice hinges on one thing: **is the key color an *ink* on this decoration,
or just background?** If it prints → `flood` (keep it). If it's background →
`color-to-alpha` (knock it out). Don't eyeball-guess, and don't blindly trust the
color list either — **run `--analyze` first** and reconcile the two:

```bash
python3 scripts/knockout_color.py --input /tmp/thumb.png --analyze \
    --expect-colors '#000000'      # the decoration's declared inks (colors[].rgb_hex)
```

Analyze writes nothing and reports:
- the auto-detected **key color**, and whether it matches a declared ink;
- **`enclosed_fraction`** — key-color pixels *inside* the art (letter counters, a
  field inside an outline). This is the number that decides whether the mode even
  matters: near-zero → both modes look the same; large → it's a real call;
- a **`recommended_mode`** derived from the inks (key color is a declared ink →
  `flood`; not → `color-to-alpha`), plus `warnings`.

**Use the color list as a guide, then verify.** The inks are operator-entered and
can be stale or wrong, so treat the recommendation as a strong prior, not a
verdict — when `decision_matters` is true, `Read` the actual cutout before
trusting it. Ask the user **only** when the signal is genuinely ambiguous
(a meaningful `enclosed_fraction` **and** the inks don't resolve it, or the inks
contradict what you see) — show both rendered options in the question. When the
inks clearly resolve it and the result looks right, just proceed.

> Example — decoration 2878 (Bacon & Co logo): declared inks `[Black]`, so white
> is *not* an ink → analyze recommends `color-to-alpha`, but flags that it removes
> ~38% of the image (the interior field). Correct call (a one-color black print
> where the garment shows through), but big enough to eyeball before uploading.

#### The thumbnail's background is not a print instruction

A decoration has two separate image artifacts — don't let one contaminate the
other:

| | `image` (thumbnail) | `dtf_production_png` (production file) |
|---|---|---|
| For | humans browsing the DB | the printer |
| Background | **keep one** — legibility wins | **none** — true cutout on transparency |
| Decides "does white print?" | never | its alpha, set from the color list |

So a thumbnail sitting on a white plate tells you **nothing** about whether that
white should print — that's what `--expect-colors` is for. **Do not assume
thumbnails have any particular background**; today they carry whatever was
supplied (a plate, a photo backdrop, or nothing), and migrating them is a slow,
separate effort. Point the knockout at the thumbnail regardless and let the color
list drive the cutout. If a thumbnail is itself hard to see (white art on a white
UI), fix the *thumbnail* with `thumbnail_card.py` (composite onto a neutral gray
or checker card) — never by baking a background into the art or the production
file.

Two failure modes this replaces — both from treating flat art as a photo or as a
hard threshold:

- *"Small halo, and white left inside the logo"* → rembg's soft matte + no
  interior handling. `color-to-alpha` removes all the white (interior included)
  with no halo; `flood` keeps the interior on purpose.
- *"The black border got all muddied up"* → a hard "make white transparent"
  threshold leaves the anti-aliased gray edge pixels fully opaque, so the smooth
  edge turns into a dirty jagged rim. `color-to-alpha` ramps those edge pixels'
  alpha instead, keeping the border crisp.

### Segmenting a photographic subject (rembg)

```bash
python3 scripts/remove_background.py --input /tmp/photo.jpg --output /tmp/cut.png
```

If the input already has meaningful transparency it is copied through unchanged
(`{"skipped": true}`); pass `--force` to re-run rembg anyway.

## Rules to follow

- **No model-generated pixels** in the compositing *or* cleanup pipeline unless
  the user explicitly asks — and say so first. Cleaning up degraded art means
  restoring its existing inks deterministically, **not** regenerating it (a
  generative model would rewrite the letterforms/text). Reviewing your own output
  is fine and required — that's judgment, not generation.
- **Inspect art at production scale before a drop.** A thumbnail hides ghosting,
  haze, and faded/jagged outlines that wreck a 13″ print. If the art is degraded
  or AI-generated, clean it with `cleanup_art.py` and `Read` the proof before
  sizing — see [Cleaning up degraded art](#cleaning-up-degraded--ai-generated-art).
- **Always self-review before returning.** `Read` the rendered PNG and
  re-compose with deltas if the placement is off, up to 3 attempts. See
  [Self-review loop](#self-review-loop-required).
- **Respect aspect ratio.** `compose_mockup.py` locks it automatically; never
  hand it raw pixel dimensions that would squash the decoration.
- **Don't assume a file exists.** Verify input paths before composing.
- **Save every mockup** so you can diff between iterations.
- **Lead with the reviewed result** (the PNG), then one line on the placement
  (and any auto-adjustment you made), then ask what to tune next.
- When ambiguous ("put it on the chest"), ask one clarifying question
  ("full front or left chest?") rather than guessing.

## When NOT to use

- The user wants a brand-new logo/design *created* from a prompt → that's
  generative image work, out of scope here.
- The user wants vector/print-ready separations, embroidery **DST** digitizing,
  or color-by-color screen seps → out of scope. (Preparing a **DTF** production
  PNG at 300 DPI *is* in scope — see [Making art production-ready](#making-art-production-ready-dtf--dropping-the-art).)
- The user wants a photoreal render with lighting/wrinkle warping → this skill
  does flat ratio-based compositing, not 3D/displacement warping.
