# Podcast Generation - Complete Podcast Production

**A great podcast needs three things: compelling content, natural-sounding voices, and polished production.** CellCog delivers all three.

- **Content quality:** #1 on DeepResearch Bench (July 2026) — scripts built on deep reasoning, not surface-level takes
- **Voice quality:** Frontier multi-voice dialogue (up to 10 distinct speakers) with natural delivery, emotional direction, interruptions, and pacing across speakers
- **Production quality:** Structured episodes with cold opens and segment transitions, original music beds ducked under speech, broadcast loudness mastering (−16 LUFS, the Apple Podcasts spec), and a ready-to-publish MP3 — all from a single prompt

## How to Use

For your first CellCog task in a session, read the **cellcog** skill for the full SDK reference — file handling, chat modes, timeouts, and more.

**OpenClaw (fire-and-forget):**
```python
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
    chat_tier="max",
)
```

**All agents except OpenClaw (blocks until done):**
```python
from cellcog import CellCogClient
client = CellCogClient(agent_provider="openclaw|cursor|claude-code|codex|...")
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="agent",
    chat_tier="max",
)
print(result["message"])
```

## Podcast Formats

| Format | Structure | CellCog Helps With |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Solo** | Just you, sharing expertise | Scripts, outlines, talking points |
| **Interview** | Host + Guest | Questions, research, show notes |
| **Co-Hosted** | Two regular hosts | Discussion outlines, segment ideas |
| **Panel** | Up to 10 distinct voices | Full audio production, structure, moderation flow |
| **Debate** | Moderator + advocates | Full audio production with distinct speaker roles |
| **Narrative** | Produced, story-driven | Scripts, story structure, character voices |
| **News/Recap** | Current events | Research, summaries, takes |

**Multi-speaker audio:** panels, debates, and roundtables are fully producible as audio — up to 10 distinct voices in one episode, each with its own role (host, expert, skeptic, color commentator). Specify the roles in your prompt; distinct roles are what keep a big panel from sounding like everyone agreeing with each other.

## Choosing Mode & Tier

**Use `chat_mode="agent", chat_tier="max"` for podcast production.** Episode structure, multi-voice scripting, and audio assembly are a deep multi-step pipeline.

| Scenario | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Full episodes, narrative series | `chat_mode="agent", chat_tier="max"` |
| Short single-voice segments | `chat_mode="agent"` (defaults to `"flash"`) |

Agent Team (`chat_mode="team"`) is reserved for deep research — podcast production runs best on Agent max.

## Full Audio Production

When you request a **full podcast episode with audio**, CellCog produces a complete, ready-to-publish episode with a real show structure:

```
[Cold Open] → [Branded Intro w/ music] → [Topic Segments + Stingers] → [Recap] → [Outro w/ music bed]
```

**What happens under the hood** — so you know what to ask for:

- **Cold open**: the episode starts mid-conversation on its most compelling moment, then the branded intro hits — not "Welcome to the show" first
- **Music that behaves like a real mix**: original intro/outro music and segment stingers, with music **ducked under speech** (sidechain compression), not just bookended
- **Broadcast loudness**: the final file is mastered to **−16 LUFS / −1 dBTP** (Apple Podcasts spec) via two-pass normalization
- **Expressive dialogue**: hosts laugh, hesitate, interrupt each other, and shift energy between segments — driven by emotional direction in the script
- **Chapter markers**: computed from the episode timeline and delivered as `chapters.json` alongside the MP3

### Customizing the Music

You can control the music in your prompt:

**Specific direction:**
> "Intro music: 10 seconds of upbeat electronic, think tech podcast energy. Use a quiet lo-fi bed under the outro CTA."

**Genre/mood direction:**
> "Use jazzy lo-fi intro music, short jazzy stingers between topics, and a calm acoustic outro."

**Recurring show (recommended):**
> "This is episode 3 of 'The Indie Hacker Pod' — reuse the same sonic brand (opener, stingers, outro) from previous episodes."

CellCog generates a reusable **sonic brand package** (opener, stinger, outro, music bed) for a show and keeps it consistent across episodes. If you say nothing about music, CellCog will choose something appropriate for your topic and tone — by default, stingers are warm and playful (never tense or alarming) and the outro music plays out to a full, natural resolve after the final sign-off.

### What You Get

| Component | What CellCog Produces |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Episode structure** | Cold open, branded intro, topic segments with stingers, recap, outro |
| **Dialogue** | Multi-voice conversation (2-10 voices) with natural delivery, reactions, and interruptions |
| **Music** | Original opener/stingers/outro + music beds ducked under speech, reusable across episodes |
| **Mastering** | Two-pass loudness normalization to −16 LUFS / −1 dBTP |
| **Final files** | Ready-to-publish MP3 + `chapters.json` for podcast apps |

### Example with Full Direction

> "Create a 10-minute podcast episode:
> 
> Topic: Why startups should hire generalists first
> Format: Interview between a host and a 3x founder
> Tone: Casual, insightful, with some humor — let them interrupt each other occasionally
> 
> Music: Upbeat indie rock opener (~10s), short stingers between the 3 main topics, mellow outro bed under the CTA
> 
> Deliver: final MP3 + chapter markers"

## Tips for Better Podcast Content

1. **Know your format**: "Conversational interview" vs "structured interview" changes the prep.

2. **Share your voice**: Give examples of your speaking style so scripts sound like you.

3. **Context on guests**: More background = better, more unique questions.

4. **Specify length**: "25 minutes spoken" helps calibrate script length.

5. **Include CTAs**: Tell us what actions you want listeners to take.

6. **Ask for chapters**: Full audio episodes come with `chapters.json` — say so if you want them embedded in your show notes too.

7. **Name your show for consistency**: mentioning the show name lets CellCog reuse the same sonic brand and voices across episodes.
