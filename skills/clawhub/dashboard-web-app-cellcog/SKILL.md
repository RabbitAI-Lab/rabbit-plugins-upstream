Build interactive dashboards, data visualizations, and web apps with AI.

## How to Use

For your first CellCog task in a session, read the **cellcog** skill for the full SDK reference — file handling, chat modes, timeouts, and more.

**OpenClaw (fire-and-forget):**
```python
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    notify_session_key="agent:main:main",
    task_label="my-task",
    chat_mode="creative",
)
```

**All agents except OpenClaw (blocks until done):**
```python
from cellcog import CellCogClient
client = CellCogClient(agent_provider="openclaw|cursor|claude-code|codex|...")
result = client.create_chat(
    prompt="[your task prompt]",
    task_label="my-task",

## Choosing Mode & Tier

**Use `chat_mode="creative"` for dashboards and web apps** — the craft-first mode tuned for design taste, visual polish, and voice.

| Scenario | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Dashboards, KPI trackers, interactive apps | `chat_mode="creative"` (default tier `"core"`) |
| Maximum craft on high-stakes pieces | `chat_mode="creative", chat_tier="max"` |
| Quick disposable drafts | `chat_mode="agent"` (defaults to `"flash"`) |

Note: `"creative"` has no `"flash"` tier. Agent Team (`chat_mode="team"`) is reserved for deep research.

## Tips for Better Dashboards

1. **Prioritize key metrics**: Don't cram everything. Lead with the 3-5 most important KPIs.

2. **Describe the data**: What columns exist? What do they mean? What time period?

3. **Specify chart types**: "Line chart for trends, bar chart for comparisons, pie for composition."

4. **Include interactivity**: "Filter by date range", "Click to drill down", "Hover for details."

5. **Design direction**: "Modern minimal", "Corporate professional", "Playful and colorful", specific color schemes.

6. **Responsive needs**: "Desktop only" vs "Must work on mobile."
