### 💡 Usage Examples

- **📋 Design a Q12 Survey** — "Help me create an engagement survey for my 30-person engineering team" → Get a customized questionnaire with standard Q12 + team-specific add-on questions
- **📈 Interpret Survey Results** — "Here are my Q1-Q12 average scores" → Get a full diagnostic report with engagement distribution, weak areas, and high-risk combinations
- **💡 Get Improvement Advice** — "Q4 and Q5 are low, what should I do?" → Receive prioritized quick-win and mid-term actions linked to specific Q12 items
- **🗺️ 90-Day Improvement Plan** — "Team engagement is only 12%, I need a plan" → Get a structured 90-day action plan with milestones and expected outcomes
- **🔍 Diagnose High-Risk Signals** — "Multiple scores below 2.5" → Identify dangerous combinations like Q1+Q4+Q5 (manager capability crisis) and get targeted interventions
- **📊 Benchmark Comparison** — "How does my team compare?" — Compare against Gallup global (23%) and China regional (17-18%) engagement benchmarks
- **🎯 Focused Diagnosis** — "I suspect management issues" → Get a focused analysis using the relevant Q12 subset (Q4, Q5, Q6, Q11) instead of the full survey

### ✨ Core Highlights

#### Complete Gallup Q12 Framework

All 12 original Gallup Q12 questions with management implications for each, organized into the four-level "climbing model":

| Level | Theme | Questions |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Base Camp | Basic Needs | Q1 (expectations), Q2 (materials/equipment) |
| Camp 1 | Individual Contribution | Q3 (strengths), Q4 (recognition), Q5 (care), Q6 (development) |
| Camp 2 | Team Belonging | Q7 (opinions), Q8 (mission), Q9 (quality), Q10 (best friend) |
| Camp 3 | Mutual Growth | Q11 (progress feedback), Q12 (learning/growth) |

#### Three Survey Versions for Different Scenarios

| Version | Questions | Best For |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Standard (Full) | All 12 Q12 items | Annual benchmarking, first-time diagnosis |
| Lite (8 items) | Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q8, Q11, Q12 | Quarterly pulse checks |
| Focused (variable) | Topic-specific subsets | Targeted diagnosis of known issues |

#### Result Interpretation Engine

Three-tier engagement classification with management signals:

- **Engaged** (avg ≥ 4.0, no item ≤ 2.0) — ~17-20% in China
- **Not Engaged** (avg 2.5-3.9) — ~60-65% in China
- **Actively Disengaged** (avg < 2.5 or multiple items ≤ 2.0) — ~15-20% in China

Plus **high-risk combination detection**: Q1+Q4+Q5 (manager crisis), Q3+Q6+Q12 (career path blockage), Q7+Q8 (disengagement), Q9+Q10 (team cohesion collapse).

#### Actionable Improvement Library

Every Q12 item has pre-built **quick-win** (within 1 week) and **mid-term** (1-3 months) actions. No generic advice — every recommendation is linked to specific low-scoring items.
