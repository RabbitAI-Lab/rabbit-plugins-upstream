# LDM OS (wip-ldm-os-private)

The installer, runtime, and hosted infrastructure for Kaleidoscope by WIP Computer, Inc.

## What this repo does

- **LDM OS installer** (`bin/ldm.js`): `ldm init`, `ldm install`, `ldm doctor`, `ldm status`. Scaffolds `~/.ldm/`, deploys extensions, wires up agents.
- **Kaleidoscope demo** (`src/hosted-mcp/demo/`): The live product at wip.computer/demo. Passkey auth, agent permission, wallet, image generation. This is the product, not a mockup.
- **Hosted MCP server** (`src/hosted-mcp/server.mjs`): OAuth 2.0 + PKCE, WebAuthn passkeys, agent auth flow, wallet tracking, Grok Imagine proxy. Lives on the VPS at wip.computer.
- **Bridge** (`src/bridge/`): Agent-to-agent communication. Local file inbox + hosted MCP.
- **Hooks** (`src/hooks/`): Claude Code and OpenClaw lifecycle hooks.
- **Shared templates** (`shared/`): CLAUDE.md templates, rules, docs deployed by `ldm install`.

## Product context

**Kaleidoscope** is the product. The consumer-facing harness. "Every AI. One experience."

**Lēsa** is the platform agent. Ours. She greets users, sets up their agents, coordinates everything. She is not the customer's agent. She makes agents for customers.

**Six products inside Kaleidoscope:**
1. Memory Crystal ... your AI remembers
2. Agent Pay ... your AI pays
3. Directory ... identity, passkeys, @handles
4. Bridge ... your AIs talk to each other
5. Code ... your AI builds
6. Crystal SDK ... add memory to your app

**LDM OS** is the kernel. Invisible. "Powered by LDM OS."

## Build and test

```bash
# No build step. Plain JS (ESM).
node bin/ldm.js --help          # CLI
node bin/ldm.js install --dry-run
node bin/ldm.js doctor

# Deploy demo to VPS:
scp src/hosted-mcp/demo/* wip-vps:/var/www/wip.computer/app/mcp-server/demo/
scp src/hosted-mcp/server.mjs wip-vps:/var/www/wip.computer/app/mcp-server/
ssh wip-vps 'pm2 restart mcp-server'
```

## Conventions

- **Never commit to main.** Branch + PR. Branch prefix: `cc-mini/`, `oc-lesa-mini/`, `cc-air/`.
- **Never squash merge.** Every commit has co-authors.
- **Worktrees** for isolated work: `.worktrees/<repo>--<branch>/`
- **Release pipeline:** merge -> `wip-release patch` -> `deploy-public.sh`
- **Release notes ownership:** release notes belong to the PR or batch that actually triggers the release. Docs-only, tracker-only, and private `ai/` PRs should not speculatively add next-alpha `RELEASE-NOTES-v*.md` files unless the current release owner explicitly marks that PR as part of an imminent release. If there is no dedicated merge/deploy agent, the agent cutting the release owns this decision.
- **Footer format:** WIP Computer, Inc. / Learning Dreaming Machines / Are you an AI Agent? | Privacy Policy | Terms of Use / Made in California.
- **Writing style:** No em dashes. Use periods, colons, semicolons, or ellipsis (...). PST timezone.

## Canonical pattern ownership

LDM OS owns canonical cross-cutting patterns for the WIP Computer agent-native ecosystem. Install prompts, SKILL.md structure, source-type schemas, track-selection logic, README install snippets, and other reusable conventions originate in `wip-ldm-os-private` and propagate down to child products (Codex Remote Control, future tools, Kaleidoscope sub-products).

The flow is **LDM OS first, children inherit.** Never the reverse.

A child-first implementation leaves the parent out of date with its own descendants. Example: on 2026-05-11 the track-aware install prompt landed in Codex Remote Control's SKILL.md but never in LDM OS's. The 2026-05-13 dogfood reproduced the gap because the LDM OS install prompt was older than its child product's install prompt. See `ai/product/bugs/installer/2026-05-11--codex--installer-track-selection-and-release-note-placement.md` for the worked example.

When a cross-cutting feature is proposed, ask: "is this pattern reusable across products?" If yes, LDM OS owns it. If no (e.g., phone pairing is Codex Remote Control specific), the child owns it.
