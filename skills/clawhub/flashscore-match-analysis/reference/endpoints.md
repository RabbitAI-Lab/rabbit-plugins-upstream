### `flashscore_match_box_score`

- **HTTP:** `GET /flashscore/match-box-score`
- **What:** Flashscore basketball, hockey and baseball box score. Returns the per-player box score of a basketball, hockey or baseball match: one table per team (hockey adds a goalkeeper table and baseball a pitcher table) with the statistic columns the provider defines for that sport, and each player's value per column, or null where Flashscore shows a dash. Other sports and matches without box-score coverage return not found.

Set-play matches add the set of each leg, the leg score within the set and the statistics of every set; a live match includes the leg being played.

### `flashscore_match_momentum`

- **HTTP:** `GET /flashscore/match-momentum`

The full response is large; narrow it with group, or with player_id for a single player. Other sports and matches without coverage return not found.

Tennis lists each game with its server, winner, the running score inside the game and break, set and match point flags, plus tiebreak points; the other sports list every rally or basket with the leading side's margin. When a tennis match is live, current_game holds the game or tiebreak in progress. Other sports and matches without coverage return not found.

Get a stage id from tournament_stage_id in the competition block of team, player and match event lists, then reuse the stage ids returned here for older seasons. Pass a stage id, not a season tournament id or a competition id: other ids can return an unrelated competition, so check the returned tournament name. An unknown stage id returns not found.
