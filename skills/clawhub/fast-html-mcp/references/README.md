> **AI talks to you through beautiful pages — not overwhelming markdown dumps.**

OpenTalk2HTML-NotMD is an MCP server that transforms how AI agents communicate with you. Instead of drowning in raw markdown files that nobody can read, AI builds clean, organized HTML pages — reports, dashboards, landing pages, invoices, anything — delivered instantly, no browser required.

---

## The Vision

**AI should communicate with humans the way humans communicate with each other: through well-designed pages, not raw text files.**

Every time an AI agent dumps markdown on you, it's choosing the easiest path for the machine — not the best path for you. OpenTalk2HTML-NotMD changes that. It gives AI agents a tool to create proper, structured, beautiful HTML pages that you can actually read, scan, and share.

**One command. Any AI platform. Real pages.**

```
npx -y @aimino/opentalk2html-notmd
```

---

## The Problem → The Solution

| 🚫 You're stuck with this | ✅ You get this instead |
|---|---|
| Raw markdown walls you can't scan | Clean HTML pages with navigation and sections |
| `## Headings` and `- bullets` everywhere | Styled reports, dashboards, and data tables |
| Scroll for 20 minutes to find one number | Jump between sections, read what matters |
| One massive file you'll never open again | Beautiful pages you'll actually share |
| AI choosing what's easy for it | AI building what's good for **you** |

## See It In Action

![OpenTalk2HTML-NotMD Demo](showcase/opentalk2html-notmd-showcase.gif)

*AI builds a real dashboard page in seconds — no browser, no Playwright, no Docker.*

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npx -y @aimino/opentalk2html-notmd
```

Add to Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, or any MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-talk-2-html-not-md": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@aimino/opentalk2html-notmd"]
    }
  }
}
```

**That's it.** Your AI agent now talks to you through pages.

## What Does This Look Like?

An AI agent using OpenTalk2HTML-NotMD can build you:

| You ask for... | Instead of markdown | AI creates |
|---|---|---|
| "Show me Q3 numbers" | `## Q3\n- Revenue: $1.2M\n- Users: 45K` | [A styled report with tables & badges](showcase/report.html) |
| "Make an invoice" | `# Invoice\n**Client:** Acme Corp` | [A proper invoice page](showcase/invoice.html) |
| "Dashboard please" | `## Metrics\n**ARR:** $10M` | [Analytics dashboard with visuals](showcase/dashboard.html) |
| "Pitch deck for investors" | Raw text with `---` slides | [Slide deck with real design](showcase/deck.html) |
| "API documentation" | Markdown with ` ``` ` blocks | [Proper API docs page](showcase/api-doc.html) |

## How It Works

OpenTalk2HTML-NotMD is a **five-tier MCP server** purpose-built for AI-to-human communication:

```
OpenTalk2HTML-NotMD MCP Server
├── Assembly   → render_page (compose pages from components)
├── Patch      → patch_html, set_attribute, edit_html_range (make surgical edits)
├── Read       → read_html (inspect with 97% token savings)
├── Raw        → write_raw_html, format_html, preview_html
├── Email      → render_email, html_to_email (send to inbox)
└── Consistency→ propagate_edit, check_consistency (keep data in sync)
```

**AI builds, edits, reads, and refines HTML pages** — the same way you'd work with a document, except it happens in milliseconds and costs pennies.

---

## Why This Exists

### The Markdown Trap

AI agents default to markdown because it's the easiest output format. But markdown was designed for lightweight text formatting, not for communicating complex AI outputs to humans. The result:

- **Users drown** in walls of raw text
- **No structure** — everything is flat, nothing is scannable
- **No visuals** — tables, charts, and badges are ASCII at best
- **No sharing** — you can't send a markdown file to a colleague

### The HTML Alternative

HTML fixes all of this: structure, navigation, styling, visuals, sharing — built in, no browser needed on the server side. The AI creates real pages that humans can actually consume.

**OpenTalk2HTML-NotMD bridges the gap:** AI writes HTML instead of markdown, and you get pages you can read, scan, and share.

## Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | OpenTalk2HTML-NotMD | Alternatives |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Cold start → first render | **~1.5s** | Playwright/Puppeteer: 5-15s |
| page render | **~900ms** | Handlebars: similar |
| Patch by #id | **~200ms** | Cheerio: 2-5s |
| Patch by CSS selector | **~800ms** | Regex: 1-3s |
| 5 sequential patches | **~2s total** | Re-parsing: 10s+ |
| Compression ratio | **40-70%** | html-minifier: 10-30% |
| AI-compressed read (106KB page) | **~1,000 tokens** (97% saved) | Raw: 30,553 tokens |

**Why is it this fast?**
1. **#id fast-path** — direct text substitution instead of full AST parsing (~10x faster)
2. **Pre-compiled doT.js** — templates compiled at startup, not render time
3. **No browser runtime** — operates on strings and AST, zero headless overhead

---

## Architecture

### The Ping-Pong Loop

```
1. Discover   → list templates & components
2. Build      → render a page
3. Inspect    → read it back (97% token savings)
4. Refine     → patch, edit, set attributes
5. Consistency→ propagate edits across sections
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **doT.js** — 10x faster compile time than Handlebars/EJS
- **#id fast-path** — direct string substitution for id-targeted edits
- **parse5** — safe AST-based HTML patching (not regex)
- **DOMPurify** — XSS prevention on all output
- **Atomic writes** — tmp file + rename to prevent corruption
- **ESM** — Node.js 20+, TypeScript, ES modules

## Token Efficiency (Why AI Agents Love This)

Designed from the ground up for AI token budgets:

### Reading a 106KB HTML Page

| Mode | Tokens | Savings | Use |
|------|--------|---------|-----|
| Text | **1,000** | **97%** | Token-minimal reading |
| Compressed | 3,909 | 87% | Summary + stats |
| Content | 7,991 | 74% | Typed blocks |
| Structure | 9,163 | 70% | Tree overview |

### Editing (500-line page, one value change)

| Approach | Tokens | When to use |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `patch_html` by id | ~2,396 | Small targets |
| `edit_html_range` | **~48** | Large containers, surgical changes |
