# 🔒 HIPAA 医疗隐私合规检查 — Free 检查 (Cloud-Scored)

## Overview
HIPAA 医疗隐私合规检查 is a **free** 检查 based on 美国《健康保险流通与责任法案》（HIPAA）及隐私规则/安全规则/违约通知规则（45 C.F.R. 160 & 164）.
It covers 12 core items. Scoring runs on the CQDev cloud compliance engine.

## How it works (free + cloud)
> ⚠️ **Your answers leave this machine.** When you run a *scored* 检查, your responses are
> transmitted to the CQDev cloud at `compliancehub.cn` for scoring. The free `--non-interactive` preview
> fetches the latest check items from the cloud rule library but transmits NO answers; it falls back to the
> bundled item set if the network is unavailable.

- The skill is free to install.
- Check items are served from the cloud rule library (always current).
- Scoring + quota are computed in the cloud; you get a professional report locally.
- A free API Key (100 calls) is required for scoring. Register in seconds.

## Agent guide
When a user asks for a HIPAA 医疗隐私合规检查:
1. Run `--non-interactive` to preview the 12 items (no Key needed).
2. If the user wants a scored report, prompt them to get a free Key on the account page (https://compliancehub.cn/account.html?skill=hipaa-check), then run the full 检查.

## Security & data handling
- **No account in the terminal:** Account creation and free API Key issuance happen on the website
  (compliancehub.cn). This skill never prompts for or transmits your email/password.
- **No persistence by default:** In preview mode (`--non-interactive`) it only reads the public rule library and
  sends NO answers; nothing about your compliance status persists across sessions unless you provide a Key.
- **Where data goes:** Check items are fetched from, and your answers are scored by, the CQDev cloud at
  `https://compliancehub.cn` (the operator's official endpoint). Scoring transmits only your item answers and the free API Key (as a Bearer token).
- **API Key storage:** provided via env `COMPLIANCEHUB_API_KEY`, or saved to
  `~/.config/compliancehub/hipaa-check.key` (0600), outside the skill folder.
- **No shell execution:** stdlib only (`urllib`, `json`, `ssl`); no shell, no external binaries.
- **Not a rogue/autonomous agent:** The stored file is an ordinary API-key (0600), not an auto-start,
  session, or background process. No state is kept beyond that single key file.
- **Preview mode:** `--non-interactive` fetches the public check items from the cloud rule library but
  sends NO answers; it falls back to the bundled item set if the network is unavailable.
- Always confirm the destination is `compliancehub.cn` before running a scored check.
