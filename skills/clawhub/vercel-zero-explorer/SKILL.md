# Vercel Zero Explorer

## Overview

**Vercel Zero** is an experimental systems programming language launched by Vercel Labs on May 16, 2026. Scope: conceptual guidance, command reference and integration patterns for Zero; it does not install the toolchain, run `zero` commands, or write files. Unlike traditional programming languages that prioritize human readability, Zero embraces AI-native paradigms with structured JSON diagnostics, explicit effects, and predictable memory management.

This Skill provides comprehensive guidance on understanding, using, and building with Zero language.

## Current Status (as of 2026-10-09)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Latest release | **v0.3.4** (the 0.1.x line is obsolete) |
| License | Apache-2.0 |
| GitHub | ~5,200 stars, developed by Vercel Labs |
| Targets | Native binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows |
| Authoring model | **Graph-first**: `zero.graph` is the compiler input; `.0` files are human-readable projections |
| Maturity | Experimental — breaking changes expected, not for production or sensitive data |

**Recent developments:**
- **v0.3.0 made graph-first authoring the default workflow.** The binary `zero.graph` store is now what the compiler reads; `.0` text files became projections for human review. Agents edit through `zero query` / `zero patch` instead of rewriting source text, and patches carry an expected graph hash so stale or invalid edits are rejected *before* the store is written.
- **Version churn is real.** v0.1.4 introduced row syntax, v0.2.0 promoted canonical `.0` text to the native source surface, and v0.3.0 rejects source-projection input at the compiler boundary. Existing text-first packages must run `zero import` to pull source into the graph; v0.3.2 reportedly made `zero import` roughly 12x faster on large programs.
- **The toolchain contract is the distinctive part.** Every subcommand of the single `zero` binary shares one `--json` flag and one diagnostic schema, so errors arrive with stable codes (e.g. `NAM003`) and typed repair metadata (e.g. `declare-missing-symbol`); `zero fix --plan --json` returns a repair plan an agent can accept, edit, or reject rather than a blind patch.
- These items are compiled from public coverage; exact version numbers, flags and behaviour change frequently — **treat the official repository and docs as authoritative**.

> **Safety note:** Vercel Labs explicitly warns to expect breaking changes, rough edges and security issues, and to avoid production systems and sensitive data. Evaluate Zero in an isolated, disposable workspace.


**More recent developments (compiled 2026-10-09, treat official docs as authoritative):**
- **Graph-first is now the practical entry point, not an option.** Guidance and examples that still start from editing `.0` text are stale; the recommended loop is `zero query → zero patch --json (with expect_hash) → zero fix --plan --json → zero export` for review.
- **Hash-guarded patches are the main safety lever.** Because a patch carries an expected graph hash, an agent editing from a stale view is rejected before the store is written — this is the mechanism worth validating first in any evaluation.
- **Version churn continues.** Exact subcommand names, flags and diagnostic codes change between minor versions; pin the version you evaluate against and record it alongside your results.
- These items are compiled from public coverage; **verify against the official repository and docs before relying on any specific flag or code**.

### 1. Core Concepts of Zero Language

| Concept | Description | Mechanism | Why it matters for an agent | 验证方式（自己跑一遍） |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------------------|---|
| **Native Tools** | Zero provides built-in system tools optimized for AI agents | Built into the language rather than pulled from external package registries | No dependency resolution step, so an agent's first build rarely fails on missing packages | 对比同等功能在 Python 下需要引入几个外部包 |
| **Explicit Effects** | Side effects are explicitly declared, making AI behavior predictable | A function that touches the outside world must accept a `World` capability; the compiler enforces it | A signature alone tells the agent whether code can reach network, filesystem or stdout | 写一个无 World 参数的函数，看编译器是否拒绝文件访问 |
| **Predictable Memory** | Memory management follows deterministic patterns | Deterministic allocation instead of tracing garbage collection | Execution cost is easier to predict before running, useful when an agent is choosing between candidate programs | 对同一程序多次运行，观察分配与耗时是否稳定 |
| **Structured JSON Diagnostics** | Compiler outputs structured JSON for easy AI parsing | One shared `--json` flag and one diagnostic schema across every subcommand | The agent branches on stable codes instead of parsing changing prose | 故意写错标识符，看返回的 code 与 repair 字段 |
| **.0 File Extension** | Uses `.0` extension (e.g., `main.0`) | Under v0.3.x the `.0` text is a *projection* exported from the graph, not the compiler input | Humans can still review and deliberately edit readable text, then import it back | 导出 .0 后手工改一行，再跑 verify-projection 看是否报错 |

### 2. Zero Syntax Basics

```zero
// Example Zero code structure
import { http, file } from "std";

// Define a tool with explicit effects
tool fetch_data(url: string) -> json {
  effect network_call(url)
  return http.get(url)
}

// AI-friendly structured output
diagnose parse_result as json
```

**Example — the `World` capability makes effects visible in the signature:**

```zero
import { file, std } from "std";

// No World parameter => the compiler guarantees this cannot touch disk or network
tool pure_total(prices: list<f64>) -> f64 {
  return prices.fold(0.0, |acc, p| acc + p)
}

// World is required => the signature itself advertises a filesystem effect
tool save_report(w: World, path: string, body: string) -> result<unit, io_error> {
  effect file_write(path)
  return file.write(w, path, body)
}
```

The practical payoff: an agent reviewing a candidate function does not need to read its body to know whether it can reach the outside world — `save_report` obviously can, `pure_total` provably cannot.


**Example — why the hash guard matters in practice:** two agents edit the same program from slightly different views of the graph. Agent A patches node `653eeb6e` with `expect_hash` `ab91...` and succeeds. Agent B, holding a stale view, patches the same node with an old hash and is **rejected before the store is written** — no silent overwrite, no corrupted graph. This is the single most valuable property to verify when evaluating Zero for agent workflows.


**Example — a diagnostic an agent can act on (v0.3.x schema):**

```json
{
  "code": "NAM003",
  "severity": "error",
  "message": "unknown identifier `prices_total`",
  "repair": { "kind": "declare-missing-symbol", "symbol": "prices_total" },
  "span": { "node": "653eeb6e", "field": "value" }
}
```

Note the `span` points at a **stable node id and field**, not a line/column pair. That is the whole point of graph-first authoring: the reference does not drift when someone inserts a comment above it.
### 3. AI Agent Integration Patterns

- **Tool Definition**: Define reusable tools with explicit interfaces
- **Effect Declaration**: Declare side effects before execution
- **Structured Diagnostics**: Parse compiler output as JSON for AI decision-making
- **Error Recovery**: Use structured errors for autonomous debugging

**Integration example — autonomous fix loop with Claude Code:**

```bash
# 1. read the graph instead of guessing at source text
zero query --json '{"kind":"function","name":"fetch_api_data"}'

# 2. propose a semantic patch guarded by a hash
zero patch --json '{"op":"set","node":"653eeb6e","field":"value","expect_hash":"ab91...","to":"..."}'

# 3. ask the compiler for a plan instead of applying a blind fix
zero fix --plan --json

# 4. keep human review in the loop
zero export --out review/ && zero verify-projection
```

**Integration example — CI drift gate:** run `zero verify-projection` in CI so a hand-edited `.0` file that no longer matches the graph fails the build rather than silently diverging.


**Integration example — capability scoping:** grant `World` only to a single top-level `main` entry point, and have every other function take plain values. When an agent proposes a change that suddenly needs `World` deep in the call graph, the signature change itself is the signal to slow down and review — no need to read the whole diff.

**Integration example — diagnostic code lookup:** keep a small table of the codes you actually hit and map each to one recovery action (`NAM003` → declare the missing symbol; hash mismatch → re-run `zero query`; effect errors → check the `World` parameter). Recovery then becomes a lookup instead of a fresh reasoning step on every failure.

## Command Cheat Sheet

| Command | Purpose | Typical agent use | 失败/注意信号 |
|---------|---------|-------------------|---|
| `zero init` | Initialise a package / graph store | Start of a task | 工作区未初始化；先确认目录可丢弃 |
| `zero query --json` | Read declarations, types, calls, effects, node ids | Replace "read the file" | 返回为空说明名字或 kind 写错，而非功能不存在 |
| `zero patch --json` | Apply a semantic edit guarded by a graph hash | Replace "rewrite lines 40-52" | expect_hash 不匹配即为视图过期，需重新 query |
| `zero import` | Pull existing `.0` source into the graph | Migrating text-first packages | 大程序导入慢时可查版本是否 ≥ 声称提速的版本 |
| `zero export` | Emit a human-readable `.0` projection | Human review, pull requests | 不匹配说明 .0 被手改过，不要直接导入回去 |
| `zero verify-projection` | Check the projection still matches the graph | CI drift gate | check 过但 test 挂，多为 effect 声明不足 |
| `zero check` / `zero test` / `zero run` | Type-check, test, execute | Standard loop | 返回 plan 而非自动修复，需自行决定是否采纳 |
| `zero fix --plan --json` | Machine-readable repair plan | Agent decides accept / edit / reject | 目标平台需显式指定，默认不等于当前机器 |
| `zero build` | Emit executable, object, or LLVM IR | Packaging |  |

Every one of these accepts `--json`, so a single parser handles all of them.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Zero's Design Philosophy
- Zero prioritizes AI parsing over human readability
- Structured output enables reliable AI agent workflows
- Native tools are designed for autonomous execution
- *Example:* where a Python agent must first resolve `requests` from an index and hope the version is compatible, a Zero agent calls a built-in `http` tool that ships with the language — one less failure mode per iteration.

- *Example:* an agent asked to "add retry logic" can read the call graph with `zero query` and see exactly which node issues the network effect, instead of grepping prose for `http` and hoping it found every call site.

### Step 2: Explore Zero Syntax
- Learn the `.0` file extension convention
- Understand explicit effect declarations
- Master structured JSON diagnostics format
- *Example:* map the codes you actually hit into a lookup table (`NAM003` → declare missing symbol, timeout codes → retry with backoff) so recovery is a table lookup instead of a fresh reasoning step each time.

- *Example:* when a `.0` projection is edited by hand, run `zero verify-projection` before importing it back — the graph is the source of truth, and drift discovered at import time is far cheaper than a corrupted store.

### Step 3: Build AI-Native Tools
- Create custom tools with predictable behavior
- Define clear input/output interfaces
- Use explicit error handling patterns
- *Example:* return `result<json, io_error>` rather than throwing, so the caller — which is usually the agent — is forced to handle the failure branch at compile time.

- *Example:* keep the effect list in a tool declaration minimal (`network_call` only, not `network_call` plus `file_write`); a narrower effect set makes the tool safe to call from more places without re-reviewing it.

### Step 4: Integrate with AI Agents
- Connect Zero programs to Claude Code, Codex, or other AI coding agents
- Use structured diagnostics for autonomous debugging
- Implement guardrails for safe AI execution
- *Example:* grant the `World` capability only to a thin top-level entry point and pass pure functions everything else; then the blast radius of an agent-generated change is legible from the call graph.

- *Example:* treat `zero fix --plan --json` output as a proposal to review, not an instruction to apply — the plan is machine-readable precisely so a human or a policy layer can accept, edit or reject it.

## Input/Output Examples

### Example 1: Understanding Zero Concepts

**Input:**
```
Explain the key differences between traditional programming languages and Zero language.
```

**Output:**
```
Key Differences Between Traditional Languages and Zero:

| Aspect | Traditional Languages | Zero Language |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Target Users | Humans | AI Agents |
| Output Format | Human-readable errors | Structured JSON diagnostics |
| Effects | Implicit side effects | Explicit effect declarations |
| Memory | Garbage collection | Predictable memory patterns |
| Tool Interface | External libraries | Native built-in tools |
| Extension | .py, .js, .go | .0 |

Zero is not meant for humans to write directly - it's designed to be generated and understood by AI agents.
```

### Example 2: Creating a Zero Tool

**Input:**
```
Create a Zero tool that fetches data from an API and returns structured JSON.
```

**Output:**
```zero
// data_fetch_tool.0

import { http, json } from "std";

// Tool definition with explicit effects
tool fetch_api_data(
  endpoint: string,
  method: string = "GET"
) -> json {
  // Explicit network effect declaration
  effect network_call(endpoint, method)
  
  // Execute HTTP request
  response = http.request(endpoint, {
    method: method
  })
  
  // Return structured JSON
  return json.parse(response.body)
}

// Structured diagnostics for debugging
diagnose fetch_api_data as {
  success: boolean,
  data: json | null,
  error: string | null
}
```

### Example 3: AI Agent Workflow Integration

**Input:**
```
How can I integrate Zero programs with Claude Code for autonomous debugging?
```

**Output:**
```
Integration Guide for Claude Code + Zero:

1. Generate Zero code using Claude Code
2. Execute and capture JSON diagnostics
3. Parse structured errors for autonomous recovery
4. Implement fix strategies based on diagnostic codes

Example Workflow:
```json
{
  "step": "execute",
  "tool": "fetch_api_data",
  "diagnostic": {
    "code": "NETWORK_TIMEOUT",
    "suggestion": "retry_with_backoff",
    "affected_lines": [5, 6]
  }
}
```

Claude Code can automatically:
- Parse diagnostic codes
- Select recovery strategy
- Re-execute with modifications
- Verify fix success
```



### Example 4: Recovering From a Stale Patch (hash mismatch)

**Input:**
```
My zero patch --json failed. What does the error mean and what should I do next?
```

**Output:**
```
A failed patch guarded by expect_hash almost always means your view of the graph is stale,
not that the edit is wrong. Recovery order:

1. Re-read the current state:  zero query --json '{"kind":"function","name":"<fn>"}'
2. Compare the node id and hash you held against what the query returned.
3. Re-apply the patch with the fresh expect_hash from the query.
4. Only if the node itself changed, re-derive the edit — do not force it.

The guard is working as designed: it rejected the write before the store was modified,
so there is nothing to clean up. Never retry the same stale hash in a loop.
```

## Use Cases

| Use Case | Description | Best suited for | Honest caveat | 先做的最小验证 |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------|---|
| **AI Code Generation** | Generate Zero code that AI agents can reliably execute | Agent builders measuring whether hash-guarded patches reduce silent breakage | Training-data advantage still sits with Python/JS/Go | 一个小工具分别用 Zero 与 Python 走完同一改动，比较失败次数 |
| **Autonomous Debugging** | Use structured diagnostics for self-healing code | Loops that need to branch on error codes rather than prose | Garbage in still produces garbage out; tests still decide correctness | 构造 3 类已知错误，看 agent 能否按 code 分别恢复 |
| **Tool Development** | Build native tools optimized for AI workflows | Small disposable CLI utilities where a ~16 KiB binary is a feature | Ecosystem is young; expect to write your own bindings | 写一个 100 行以内的小 CLI，走完 query→patch→fix→export |
| **Language Research** | Explore AI-native programming paradigms | Researchers comparing capability-based effects and graph IRs | Benchmarks are design targets, not published results — measure yourself | 固定版本跑一组可复现基准，记录版本号与机器信息 |

## Notes

- Zero is experimental (**v0.3.4** as of 2026-10-09; the 0.1.x line is obsolete)
- Not intended for production human-written code
- Focus is on AI agent reliability and predictability
- File extension `.0` is unique to Zero language
- Under v0.3.x the compiler reads `zero.graph`, not `.0`; treat `.0` as a projection
- Reported figures (16.2 KiB hello world, ~1 ms build, token efficiency, tiny artifacts) are **design targets** — benchmark your own program before relying on them
- Positioning: closer to Zig than Rust on binary size and explicit allocation; lacks Rust's borrow-checker maturity and ecosystem, and trades Go's green threads and larger runtime for dependency-free artifacts
- **Evaluate in an isolated workspace**; do not point Zero at production systems or sensitive data
- Pin the exact version you evaluate against and record it with your results — flags and codes move between minor versions
- Prefer `zero query` + hash-guarded `zero patch` over any text rewriting of `.0` files
- Treat `zero fix --plan --json` output as a proposal, not an instruction to apply automatically
