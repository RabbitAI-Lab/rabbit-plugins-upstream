This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

## Publisher:

### License/Terms of Use:

MIT-0

## Use Case:

Developers, DevOps engineers, and system administrators use this skill to inspect Linux disk health signals, set up SMART-based sentinel monitoring, and reason about backup placement and restore-drill findings.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Formatting or persistent mount guidance can destroy data or target the wrong partition if device identity is not independently verified.

Mitigation: Verify the exact device using stable identifiers, confirm current backups, check for existing or damaged filesystems, and accept the destructive impact before running any formatting or fstab commands.

Risk: SMART monitoring examples are tied to specific local device names and sudo smartctl behavior, which may produce incomplete or misleading results on different systems.

Mitigation: Adapt device paths, thresholds, baseline locations, and sudo permissions to the target host before relying on alerts or automated self-tests.
