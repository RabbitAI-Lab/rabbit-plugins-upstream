## SA Five Hats Model

As a Solution Architect, switch roles across scenarios. This Skill supports all five modes:

| Hat | Mode | Time Scale | Core Outputs |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| **Discoverer** | Curious, listening, slow | Days | Interview notes, context map, problem statement |
| **Designer** | Deep, abstract, system-level | Days-Weeks | Architecture outline, C4 diagrams, ADR records |
| **Negotiator** | Diplomatic, fast, decisive | Hours-Days | Decision log, stakeholder alignment, scope clarification |
| **Salesperson** | Confident, narrative, value-driven | Days-Weeks | Solution PPT, RFP response, executive briefing |
| **Operator** | Pragmatic, hands-on | Ongoing | Runbook, governance gates, delivery escalation |

**Core Principle**: Batch work by "hat," not by topic. During discovery, only discover — don't design. During sales, sell — don't get bogged down in design.

## Seven Iron Laws of Solution Architecture

1. **You sell solutions, not technology** — Solution ≠ technology stack. Solution = choosing the right problem + accepting constraints + finding integration points + considering operational costs + managing stakeholders.
2. **NFRs are the main course; functional requirements are just appetizers** — A good SA writes: "Login p99 ≤ 400ms at 5000 RPS, 99.95% availability, Admin mandatory MFA, SOC 2 audit retained 7 years."
3. **Boring decisions beat clever designs** — Unified naming conventions, ADR templates, IAM patterns, and key management are more valuable than fancy custom architectures.
4. **Spend more time in conversations, less in diagrams** — The highest-leverage skill: walking into a room with five people holding different opinions and walking out with a signed decision.
5. **Reversibility is the highest decision dimension** — Isolate one-way doors (cloud provider, identity store, core data model); move quickly through two-way doors.
6. **Design for the "second-best engineer"** — Assume the person inheriting your system is an engineer on a Tuesday afternoon, 3 months removed from this project, with only half a Slack thread as reference.
7. **Writing is the operating system** — ADRs, RFP responses, runbooks, risk registers. SAs who write clearly scale their influence faster.

## Architecture Methodology Toolbox

This Skill integrates three industry-standard architecture methodologies, switching flexibly by scenario:

### C4 Model (Software System Architecture Visualization Magnifying Glass)

| Level | Name | Answers the Question | Audience |
|------|------|-----------|------|
| **C1** | System Context Diagram | What is the system? Who uses it? What external systems does it connect to? | Everyone (including non-technical) |
| **C2** | Container Diagram | What technical services/apps/databases compose the system? | Dev, Ops, Architects |
| **C3** | Component Diagram | What modules exist inside each container? | Internal developers |
| **C4** | Code Diagram (optional) | How are classes and interfaces organized? | Code review, refactoring |

> Recommendation: Level 0 System Landscape → C1 Context → C2 Container — three layers cover 90% of scenarios. C3-C4 code diagrams are only for critical modules.

### C4 Model "Map-Style Zoom" Philosophy

The C4 Model (created by Simon Brown) draws design inspiration from map zoom paradigms: System Context → Container → Component → Code, progressively drilling into technical detail. Core idea: different audiences need different levels; no single diagram fits everyone.

| Level | Audience | Question | Zoom Analogy |
|------|------|------|---------|
| C1 System Context | Everyone (including non-technical) | What is the system? What external systems connect? | Country view |
| C2 Container | Dev, Ops, Architects | What technical services/apps/databases compose the system? | City view |
| C3 Component | Internal developers | What modules exist inside each container? | Street view |
| C4 Code | Code review, refactoring | How are classes and interfaces organized? | Building view |

### Diagrams as Code — Three Musketeers

| Tool | Language | Positioning | Recommended Scenario |
|------|------|------|---------|
| **Structurizr DSL** | Proprietary DSL | C4 Model native tool | Full C4 series, CI Pipeline integration |
| **PlantUML** | Natural-language-like | General UML/C4 drawing | Sequence/Activity/C4 mixed use |
| **Mermaid** | Markdown-embedded | Lightweight documentation diagrams | README/doc embedding, GitHub/GitLab native rendering |

> **Practical Advice**: For presales proposals, use draw.io to generate ultra-high-quality editable versions. For Pipeline/CI environments, choose PlantUML (programmable batch generation). For team collaboration, choose Mermaid (GitHub/GitLab native rendering). For heavy C4 usage, choose Structurizr DSL (C4-native philosophy).

### 4+1 View Model (Five Stakeholder Perspectives)

| View | Purpose | Recommended Diagrams |
|------|------|----------|
| **Logical View** | Functional decomposition, component relationships | Functional Architecture Diagram, Class Diagram, Component Diagram |
| **Development View** | Source modules, build organization | Package Diagram, Module Diagram |
| **Process View** | Runtime behavior, concurrency, communication | Sequence Diagram, Activity Diagram |
| **Physical View** | Deployment to hardware/cloud | Deployment Architecture Diagram, Network Topology |
| **+1 Scenarios** | Use cases connecting all views | Business Process Diagram, User Story Map |

### TOGAF Enterprise Architecture (4A Architecture Layers)

```
Business Architecture → Application Architecture → Data Architecture → Technology Architecture
(Strategy-driven, top-down decomposition)
```

### Methodology Combination Recommendations

| Scenario | Recommended Combination |
|------|----------|
| Executive Briefing / Presales Proposal | TOGAF Capability Map + C4 C1 Context Diagram |
| Solution Design Document | 4+1 Logical+Physical Views + C4 C2 Container Diagram |
| Developer Handover | C4 C2+C3 Component Diagram + Sequence Diagram |
| Iteration Planning | C4 C3 Component Diagram + Lightweight ADR |
| Enterprise-Level IT Planning | TOGAF 4A Full Stack + C4 Level 0 System Landscape |

---## TOGAF ADM 9-Phase Complete Lifecycle

| **Phase F** | Migration roadmap, work package breakdown, resource plan | PMO, Implementation Team |
| **Phase G** | Compliance review, architecture contracts, implementation monitoring | Architecture Board |
| **Phase H** | Change request assessment, architecture update, governance adjustment | Architecture Board |

### Architecture Governance Three-Stage Model

```
Develop  ──►  Implement  ──►  Deploy
(Architecture    (Implementation   (Deployment
 Development)     Supervision)      Verification)
    │              │               │
    ▼              ▼               ▼
 Architecture   Architecture    Architecture
 Contract       Compliance      Conformance
```

| Governance Stage | Core Activities | Responsible Role | Key Deliverables |
|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Develop** | Architecture development, review, approval | Chief Architect | Architecture Definition Document, ADR |
| **Implement** | Implementation supervision, change handling, compliance review | Architecture Board | Architecture Compliance Report, Change Assessment |
| **Deploy** | Deployment verification, migration confirmation, go-live approval | PMO + Board | Deployment Confirmation, Go-Live Approval |

### Governance Role Matrix

| Role | Core Responsibilities | Decision Authority | Meeting Frequency |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| **CIO** | IT strategy alignment, investment prioritization, resource allocation | Approve architecture principles and major investments | Quarterly |
| **CTO** | Technology strategy, platform selection, tech debt management | Approve technology standards and selection | Monthly |
| **Chief Architect** | Architecture integrity, architecture governance, standards development | Approve architecture decisions and contracts | Weekly |
| **Architecture Board** | Compliance review, change assessment, standards maintenance | Approve exception requests | Bi-weekly |
| **Solution Architect** | Specific solution architecture design, ADR authoring | Approve component-level decisions | Weekly |
| **Domain Architect** | Domain architecture (data/application/security) | Approve domain standards | As needed |

### ADM Three Iteration Levels

| Iteration Level | Scope | Object | Typical Cycle |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| **Full-Cycle Iteration** | Re-execute entire ADM cycle | Major architecture transformation | 1-3 years |
| **Inter-Phase Iteration** | Feedback loops between phases | Incremental architecture delivery | 3-6 months |
| **Intra-Phase Iteration** | Multiple refinements within a single phase | Architecture detail refinement | 1-4 weeks |

> **Practical Advice**: For presales proposals, typically only a lightweight path of "Preliminary → Phase A → Phase B (summary) → Phase C/D (summary) → Phase E" is needed — not the full 8-phase implementation. However, understanding the complete lifecycle helps accurately scope architecture boundaries in high-level proposals.

## Wardley Mapping Strategic Decision Framework

Wardley Mapping (created by Simon Wardley) is a strategic decision framework that visualizes the position and evolution stage of each component on the value chain, helping enterprises make key decisions on build/buy/outsource/standardize.

### Value Chain Visualization

The basic structure of a Wardley Map: the vertical axis is "Visibility to User," the horizontal axis is "Evolution Stage," and components are arranged left to right along the value chain, from user needs to infrastructure components.

### Four-Stage Evolution Model

| Stage | Characteristics | Competitive Dimension | Practical Implication | Decision Recommendation |
|------|------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Genesis** | Brand new, poorly understood, extremely scarce | Exploration & validation | Market does not yet exist | Self-build or partner with academia |
| **Custom** | Market forming, immature products | Differentiation & customization | Expensive, requires specialist skills | Custom development or procure leading products |
| **Product** | Productized, mature market | Features & price | Multiple vendors available | Procure commercial products |
| **Commodity** | Standardized, pay-per-use | Efficiency & scale | Utility/on-demand services | Use cloud services/SaaS |

### Cynefin Framework: Four Context Decision Methods

| Context Type | Characteristics | Causality | Decision Method | Architecture Example |
|---------|------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Clear** | Known best practices | Obvious | Sense → Categorize → Respond | Relational database selection |
| **Complicated** | Requires expert analysis | Can be analyzed | Sense → Analyze → Respond | Microservice decomposition strategy |
| **Complex** | Unpredictable | Only explainable in retrospect | Probe → Sense → Respond | AI model selection / technology trends |
| **Chaotic** | Highly turbulent | Cannot be sensed | Act → Sense → Respond | P0 incident / supply chain attack |

> **Practical Advice**: In presales proposals, 60% of architecture problems fall into the "Complicated" quadrant (requiring architect professional analysis), 20% into "Clear" (existing best practices), 15% into "Complex" (requiring exploration and validation), and 5% into "Chaotic" (generally outside presales scope). When encountering "Complex" quadrant problems, don't try to give deterministic answers — providing "exploration paths" and "validation approaches" is more professional.

## Phase 1: Requirements Understanding & Client Material Analysis

### 1.1 SPIN Selling Methodology

After receiving client requirements, use the SPIN method for structured analysis:

| SPIN Dimension | Meaning | Analysis Questions |
|-----------|------|----------|
| **S**ituation | Client current state | Current business processes? Systems in use? Organizational structure? |
| **P**roblem | Existing difficulties | Efficiency bottlenecks? Data silos? Redundant work? |
| **I**mplication | Consequences of inaction | Cost losses? Compliance risks? Competitiveness decline? |
| **N**eed-Payoff | Value after resolution | Cost reduction? Efficiency gain? New business opportunities? |

### 1.2 Client Material Analysis Process

**Step 1: Thoroughly Read All Client Materials**
- Supported formats: .pptx / .docx / .pdf / .jpg / .png / .xlsx / text
- Clients typically provide: research reports, existing process diagrams, pain point descriptions, blueprint drafts (if available), requirements specifications

**Step 2: Cross-Reference Analysis**
- Cross-compare multiple documents
- Mark contradictions as "To Be Clarified"
- Mark gaps as "To Be Supplemented"

**Step 3: Output Structured Analysis Report**

```
## Client Requirements Analysis

### Client Profile
- Industry/Domain
- Enterprise scale (employees/revenue)
- IT maturity (Level 1-5, with supporting evidence)
- Key stakeholders (2×2 influence/power matrix)

### Business Current State
- Core value chain/business processes
- Existing system inventory (including tech stack, vintage, operational status)
- Data asset status (structured/unstructured, volume, quality)
- IT team size and capability

### Pain Points & Challenges (Prioritized)
- P0 (Critical): Directly impacts business operations
- P1 (Severe): Significantly impacts efficiency or quality
- P2 (General): Local optimization opportunity

### Goals & Expectations
- Business goals (quantifiable)
- Technical goals (quantifiable)
- Expected ROI / payback period

### Constraints
- Budget range (hard constraint / soft constraint)
- Timeline (deadline / desired)
- Technology stack preferences/restrictions (why)
- Compliance/security requirements (classified protection, GDPR, industry regulation)

### Opportunity Identification
- AI/intelligent opportunities (efficiency improvement / decision support / experience upgrade)
- Process reengineering opportunities (automation / de-manualization / serial-to-parallel)
- System integration opportunities (data connectivity / capability reuse)
- Data value mining opportunities (reporting → analysis → prediction → decision)
```

### Key Rules

- **No guessing**: Mark information not present in materials as "To Be Confirmed" and list recommended verification methods
- **Quantification first**: Extract quantitative metrics wherever possible; provide industry benchmarks when not possible
- **Cross-reference analysis**: Cross-correlate multiple documents; proactively flag contradictions/inconsistencies
- **NFR first**: Pay attention to non-functional requirements (performance, security, availability, scalability) from the start

---## Phase 2: Research & Meeting Support

### 2.1 Research Meeting Agenda Design

Based on requirements analysis, generate meeting agendas using the five-step method:

```
## Research Meeting Agenda

### Basic Information
- Topic / Time / Location / Attendees (mark decision-makers)

3. Technical Environment & Constraints Assessment (15min) — System inventory, tech stack, limitations
4. Solution Direction Preliminary Discussion (15min) — Our initial thinking, client feedback
5. Next Steps Alignment (5min) — Information supplement list, next meeting time

### Information Collection Checklist (Gap List)
- Ranked by confirmation urgency, with responsible party noted

### Anticipated Q&A (Q&A Prep)
- Grouped by topic (Technical/Commercial/Implementation/Security/Operations)
```

### 2.2 Meeting Minutes Standardized Template

```
## Meeting Minutes

### Basic Information
Meeting Topic | Time | Location | Attendees (mark roles)

### Core Conclusions (Top 3-5, Most Important)
1. 
2. 

### Detailed Discussion

- Action Items (Owner @ + Due Date YYYY-MM-DD)

### Disagreements & Unresolved Items
- Disagreement Point | Both Positions | Suggested Resolution | Planned Discussion Time

### Next Steps

### Action Item Tracking Table
| # | Action Item | Owner | Due Date | Priority | Status |
|---|--------|--------|----------|--------|------|
```

### 2.3 Client Communication Anticipation & Response Strategy Handbook

Organize anticipated questions by dimension:

| Dimension | Example Question | Response Key Points | Supporting Material | NG Behavior |
|------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Technical | "How do you compare to Competitor X?" | Differentiated advantages + scenario fit | Competitive comparison table | Belittling competitors |
| Commercial | "What if the budget is insufficient?" | Phased construction + ROI analysis | TCO model | Easily agreeing to price cuts |
| Security | "What about data security?" | Encryption + access control + audit | Security whitepaper | Over-promising |
| Implementation | "How long until go-live?" | Phased delivery + dependency explanation | Milestone plan | Compressing timeline |
| Service | "What about operations?" | Service levels + response mechanisms | SLA template | Promising unachievable metrics |

### Diagram Reference & Delivery Standards

- Use placeholders in proposal documents for diagram positions: `【Figure X.X: Insert [Diagram Name].png here】`
- Diagram files stored independently in `project_folder/diagrams/` directory
- Deliver both `.drawio` source files + `.png` previews
- Naming convention: `[Diagram Type]-[Topic]-V[Version].drawio`
- **Do not embed directly in documents**: Keep documents lightweight for easier version management and independent editing

### Version Management Standards

- File naming: `【YYYYMMDD】Project-Short-Name-Document-Type-VVersion.extension`
- Version number rules: Vx.y (x = major version/structure changes, y = minor version/content revisions)
- Each version retains PDF archive; Word is the current working version

---## Phase 5: Diagram Factory (13 Types of Professional Diagrams)

This is the signature capability of this Skill — precision generation of various professional diagrams for solutions.

### 5.0 General Diagram Standards (Apply to ALL Diagrams)

#### Tool Selection & Installation Check

**Default Tool**: draw.io (diagrams.net) — free, open-source, cross-platform, industrial-grade, rich ecosystem.

**⚠️ Must Execute Before First Use**:
1. Check if user has draw.io desktop installed (`draw.io --version` or check `/Applications/draw.io.app`)
2. If not installed → guide installation:
   - macOS: `brew install --cask drawio`
   - Windows: `winget install drawio`
   - Or visit https://www.drawio.com/ to download
   - Or use the free web version https://app.diagrams.net/
3. If not installing → inform impact: no offline editing, no CLI batch export, inconvenient collaboration, potential formatting issues in proposal diagrams
4. If user insists on not installing → recommend VS Code extension `hediet.vscode-drawio` (in-IDE editing, lightweight solution)

#### General Delivery Standards

- **Dual-file delivery**: `.drawio` source file + `.png` preview, same name, same path
- **Independent storage**: All diagrams in `project_folder/diagrams/` directory
- **Naming convention**: `[Diagram Type]-[Topic]-V[Version].drawio`
- **Proposal references**: Only reference .png in documents, do not embed .drawio

#### Professional Diagramming Principles (from Draw.io Style Guide Best Practices)

| Principle | Description |
|------|------|
| **Shape Vocabulary** | Use consistent shapes for same element types: rectangle = service/database, hexagon = gateway, circle = user/external entity |
| **Color Semantics** | Establish color coding system for different layers/domains/states, maintain global consistency |
| **Line Type Semantics** | Solid = primary data flow, dashed = secondary/async, thick = critical path, dotted = management flow |
| **Arrow Directionality** | Solid arrowhead = data flow, hollow arrowhead = dependency, no arrowhead = bidirectional sync |
| **Minimal Palette** | Core colors ≤ 5, black/white/grey as base, color only for highlighting key elements |
| **Unified Font** | Sans-serif font throughout (Arial/Helvetica), 12-14px main, 18-20px titles |
| **Grid Alignment** | Enable Snap to Grid, coordinates at multiples of 10 |
| **Version Tracking** | Place version number + date label inside diagram, filename includes version number |

#### draw.io XML File Structure Template

Generated `.drawio` files must include complete XML structure:

```xml
<mxfile host="Claude" modified="YYYY-MM-DD" agent="Claude Code" version="24.0.0">
  <diagram name="Page-1" id="Page-1">
    <mxGraphModel dx="1600" dy="1200" grid="1" gridSize="10" guides="1" tooltips="1" 
                  connect="1" arrows="1" fold="1" page="1" pageScale="1" 
                  pageWidth="1600" pageHeight="1200" math="0" shadow="0">
      <root>
        <mxCell id="0" />
        <mxCell id="1" parent="0" />
        <!-- All graphic elements -->
      </root>
    </mxGraphModel>
  </diagram>
</mxfile>
```

#### Diagram Generation Workflow

1. **User describes requirements** → Confirm diagram type and content scope
2. **Output ASCII sketch** → For user to confirm layout, hierarchy, main elements
3. **After user confirmation** → Generate complete draw.io XML, write to `.drawio` file
4. **Attempt PNG export** → Auto-export if draw.io CLI available; otherwise inform user of manual export method
5. **Inform path** → Remind that it can be opened in draw.io for fine-tuning

- External Systems: Grey rounded rectangle `fillColor=#ECEFF1;strokeColor=#90A4AE`
- Interactions: Solid arrow + protocol label (REST/gRPC/MQ/File)

**Layout**: Core system centered, users left or above, external systems right or below, connections labeled with interaction purpose.

### 5.2 Container Diagram (C4 Level 2)

**Applicable Scenario**: Architecture design, technical solution detail.

**Element Standards**:
- Mobile App / SPA: `fillColor=#42A5F5` (Blue)
- Web App / Backend Service: `fillColor=#66BB6A` (Green)
- Database: `shape=cylinder3;fillColor=#AB47BC` (Purple)
- Message Queue / Cache: `fillColor=#FFA726` (Orange)
- File System / Object Storage: `fillColor=#78909C` (Grey)
- System Boundary Box: `dashed=1;fillColor=none;strokeColor=#333333`

### 5.3 Technical Architecture Diagram

**Applicable Scenario**: Layered display of the technical landscape from infrastructure to frontend applications.

### Internet Layered Architecture Five-Layer Model Reference

The standard layered architecture for modern enterprise systems, also the foundational reference model for technical architecture diagrams in presales proposals:

| Layer | Responsibility | Typical Technology Selection | Key NFR |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Client Layer** | User interaction, device adaptation | React/Vue/Flutter, Electron, Mini Programs | First screen load <3s, multi-device consistency |
| **Access Layer** | Traffic ingress, security protection | Nginx/Kong/APISIX, CDN, WAF | 99.99% availability, TLS 1.3 |
| **Application Layer** | Business logic, process orchestration | Spring Boot/Go/Node.js, K8s | P99<500ms, graceful degradation |
| **Service Layer** | Shared services, platform capabilities | Microservices/Service Mesh, gRPC/Dubbo | Service discovery <1s, circuit breaker RTO<60s |
| **Data Layer** | Data persistence, caching | MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis, ES, Kafka | RPO<5min, RTO<30min |

**Standard Layering** (top to bottom):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Access Layer │ Web / Mobile / H5 / OpenAPI / Gateway │  #E3F2FD
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Application Layer │ Microservice Cluster / Business Modules / Job Scheduler │  #E8F5E9
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Platform Layer │ Middleware / AI / Messaging / Search / Process Engine │  #FFF3E0
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Data Layer │ OLTP / OLAP / Cache / Search Engine / Data Lake │  #F3E5F5
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Infrastructure Layer │ Cloud / K8s / Network / Storage / Security Groups │  #ECEFF1
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ← Security System (vertical penetration) →  ← Operations System (vertical penetration) →
```

**Key Rules**:
- Use horizontal swimlanes or large containers for each layer
- Layer-internal components use rounded rectangles, grouped arrangement
- Security and operations systems use vertical lines/color bars penetrating from top to bottom
- Each layer container fill color has 30-40% color difference from internal component fill colors
- External systems/third-party services placed in the rightmost column as independent area

### 5.4 Business Process Diagram

**Applicable Scenario**: End-to-end business processes, approval flows, decision branches, exception handling.

**Swimlane Standards**:
- Horizontal swimlanes: each row represents a role/department/system
- Swimlane title width 30px (`startSize=30`)
- Role background colors: human roles light warm, system roles light cool

**BPMN Elements Mapped to draw.io**:
| BPMN Element | draw.io Shape | Style |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Start Event | Thin ring | `ellipse;fillColor=#C8E6C9;strokeColor=#388E3C` |
| End Event | Thick ring | `ellipse;fillColor=#FFCDD2;strokeColor=#D32F2F;strokeWidth=3` |
| Task/Activity | Rounded rectangle | `rounded=1;fillColor=#FFFFFF;strokeColor=#333333` |
| Gateway (Exclusive) | Diamond | `rhombus;fillColor=#FFF9C4`, label "X" inside |
| Gateway (Parallel) | Diamond | `rhombus;fillColor=#FFF9C4`, label "+" inside |
| Data Object | Top-right folded rectangle | `shape=document` |
| Annotation | Left-folded rectangle | Dashed border, light yellow fill |

**Connection Rules**:
- Normal flow: Solid line `strokeColor=#333333;endArrow=classic`
- Message flow: Dashed `dashed=1;dashPattern=8 8`
- Exception/compensation flow: Red dashed `strokeColor=#D32F2F;dashed=1`

### 5.5 Data Flow Diagram (DFD — Level 0-2 Multi-Level)

**Applicable Scenario**: How data flows, processes, and stores between system modules.

**DFD Level Strategy**:

| Level | Name | Content | Audience |
|------|------|------|------|
| **Level 0** | Context Diagram | System as single process + external entities | Everyone |
| **Level 1** | Major Sub-Processes | 3-7 main processes + data stores | Technical+Business |
| **Level 2** | Detailed Decomposition | Internal detailed data flow of each Level 1 process | Dev, Architects |
| **Level 3** | Atomic | Rarely used, only for extremely complex systems | Deep technical |

**DFD Four Elements (Standard Notation)**:
| Element | Shape | draw.io Implementation |
|------|------|-------------|
| External Entity | Rectangle (double border or bold) | `strokeWidth=2;fillColor=#E3F2FD` |
| Process | Circle or rounded rectangle | `ellipse` or `rounded=1` (number inside) |
| Data Store | Open rectangle or cylinder | `shape=cylinder3;fillColor=#F3E5F5` |
| Data Flow | Arrow line | `strokeWidth=2;endArrow=classic`, label data content |

**Recommended Method**: Use draw.io's multi-page diagram feature — one DFD level per page, higher-level shapes link to lower-level detail pages, achieving natural drill-down navigation.

### 5.6 Functional Architecture Diagram

**Applicable Scenario**: System functional module partitioning and hierarchical relationships.

**Three-Level Tree Layout**:
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Platform / Product Name              │  ← Top title bar
├────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬────────────────┤
│   Module A │   Module B │   Module C │    Module D    │  ← Level-1 Modules
│  #1E88E5  │  #43A047  │  #FB8C00 │   #8E24AA     │
├──┬──┬─────┤──┬──┬─────┤──┬──┬─────┤──┬──┬──────────┤
│A1│A2│A3  │B1│B2│B3  │C1│C2│C3  │D1│D2│D3       │  ← Level-2 Functions
└──┴──┴─────┘──┴──┴─────┘──┴──┴─────┘──┴──┴──────────┘
```

**Rules**:
- Level-1 modules: 4-8, each using independent color scheme (blue/green/orange/purple/cyan/pink, hue spacing ≥45°)
- Level-2 functions: 3-6 per module
- Module separation: 5-10px spacing or light grey dashed lines
- For more levels, use expand/collapse (multi-page links)

### 5.7 System Integration Diagram

**Applicable Scenario**: Core system and external/peripheral system integration landscape.

**Layout**: Core system centered (160×120px, dark blue fill + white text), external systems arranged around.

**Integration Method Visual Encoding**:

- High availability annotation: "Primary," "Standby," "Multi-Active" badges

### 5.9 Data Architecture Diagram

**Five-Layer Standard Structure**:
```
Data Source Layer    → Business DB / Tracking / IoT / External Data / Files
Data Integration Layer → CDC / Kafka / ETL / Flink
Data Storage Layer   → ODS → DW/DM → Data Lake → Feature Store
Data Service Layer   → API / Metrics Platform / Tag Platform / AI Features
Data Application Layer → BI Reports / Dashboards / Data Products / Intelligent Decision
        Data Governance (Metadata → Data Quality → Data Security → Data Standards) vertical penetration
```

### 5.10 Business Architecture Diagram (Capability Map)

**Applicable Scenario**: Enterprise-level business capability landscape, value stream mapping.

**Structure**:
- Top: Business value streams (L1 end-to-end processes)
- Middle: Core business capability domains + enabling capability domains (arranged by value chain)
- Bottom: Supporting platforms (Technology/Data/Collaboration)
- Color by "Strategic-Core-Supporting" three tiers

### 5.11 Network Topology Diagram

**Professional Drawing Standards**:
- Hub-Spoke structure clearly differentiated
- All network segments annotated with CIDR addresses
- NSG (Network Security Groups) and UDR (Route Tables) markers
- Internal/external network DMZ zones clearly demarcated
- Use color for health status: Green=Normal, Yellow=Warning, Red=Fault (operations view)

### 5.12 Implementation Roadmap / Gantt Chart

**Structure**: Horizontal axis = time (weeks/months/quarters), vertical axis = workstreams/phases/modules.
- Time blocks use different colors for phases
- Key milestones marked (diamond/flag)
- Dependencies connected with arrows
- Each phase's deliverables annotated

### 5.13 AI/Intelligent Solution Diagram

**Structure**:
```
AI Application Layer       → Assistant / Process Automation / Insights / Decision / Agent Orchestration Entry
Multi-Agent Orchestration  → Orchestrator-Worker / Supervisor patterns; task decomposition, role assignment, collaboration & fallback
AI Service Platform Layer  → LLM Gateway / AI Gateway / RAG 2.0 Engine / Agent Framework / Model Serving / LLMOps
MCP Tool Integration Layer → MCP Server/Client; standardized tool access to external systems/APIs/data/actions (successor to Function Calling)
AI Model Layer             → Tiered Routing: small (classification/extraction) / mid (dialogue/RAG) / large (reasoning/planning) / reasoning (o1/R1-class)
Data & Feedback Layer      → Knowledge Base / Vector DB / Labeled Data / Human-in-the-loop Feedback
          ← Guardrails (Prompt Injection / Jailbreak Defense / Red Teaming) + AI Cost Governance (token/inference accounting) + Observability (vertical) →
```

> **2026 upgrade**: The structure above extends the original four layers into an "AI-Native Architecture", adding MCP tool-integration layer, multi-agent orchestration, RAG 2.0, LLMOps/AI gateway, model tiered routing, AI evaluation & guardrails, AI cost governance, and vector database selection. The original four layers (Application/Platform/Model/Data) are fully retained.

**RAG 2.0 essentials** (replaces naive "vector search + prompt stuffing"):
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: dense (vectors) + sparse (BM25/full-text) fused reranking, improves long-tail/proper-noun recall
- **GraphRAG**: graph-structured entity relations for multi-hop reasoning and global summarization (Microsoft open-source paradigm, 2024+)
- **Re-ranking**: Cross-Encoder / rerank models rerank candidates for precision
- **Context Compression**: query rewrite, context pruning, redundancy removal to cut token cost and hallucination
- **Knowledge Governance**: chunking strategy, versioning, citation/source tracing, freshness labeling

**Vector DB Selection (2025–2026)**:
| Vector DB | Positioning | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Milvus** | Distributed, large-scale, production-grade | Billion-scale vectors, high-QPS retrieval |
| **PGVector** | PostgreSQL extension | Existing PG stack, mid-scale, ACID + vector in one |
| **Qdrant** | Rust, strong filtering | Semantic search with payload filtering, cloud-native |
| **Chroma** | Lightweight, embedded, dev-friendly | Prototypes/POC, embedded RAG |
| (also Weaviate / Pinecone / Redis Stack) | | |

**Model Tiered Routing**: route by task complexity & cost — simple classification/extraction to small models (low latency, near-zero cost); complex reasoning/planning to large or reasoning models; balance quality, latency, and token cost via a routing policy.

**AI Evaluation & Guardrails**:
- **Prompt Injection / Jailbreak Defense**: input sanitization, least privilege, confirmation for sensitive actions
- **Red Teaming**: adversarial samples, jailbreak attempts, data-leak testing as pre-launch evaluation
- **Evaluation**: RAGAS / objective metrics (faithfulness, answer relevancy) + business metrics + human sampling

**AI Cost Governance**:
- Account costs per token / inference call; build "cost per answer / cost per task" dashboards
- Caching hits, small-model offload, context compression, batching to lower unit cost
- Budget alerts & anomaly detection (extend FinOps three-phase cycle to AI spend)

**LLMOps / AI Gateway**: model versioning, canary release, traffic routing, rate-limiting/circuit-breaking, audit logs, eval regression, prompt versioning — consolidated at the AI gateway.

> **Companion template**: New `templates/ai-adr-template.md` (AI Selection ADR template) standardizes high-risk decisions such as "adopt Agent or not / which model / vector DB & RAG strategy / guardrails & cost red lines".

- **No mixed spacing**: Uniform 0.3" or 0.5", pick one
- **No default blue**: Color scheme reflects topic and industry
- **No same layout three slides in a row**: Vary columns, cards, callouts

### PPT QA Process (Must Execute)

1. Slide-by-slide check: text overflow, element overlap, uneven spacing
2. Check diagram sources: PNGs referenced from `diagrams/` must be high-res (≥ 1920×1080)
3. Check contrast: text/icons on dark backgrounds must be clearly visible
4. Check content completeness: key slides not missing, key numbers not lost
5. Final check: look for AI traces (title underlines, cookie-cutter layouts)

---## Phase 8: Cloud Financial Management (FinOps)

FinOps is the IT financial management practice for the cloud era, achieving cloud cost visibility, control, and optimization through cross-functional (Technology + Finance + Business) collaboration. Adding a FinOps perspective to presales proposals shows clients "not just how to do it, but how much it costs and how to save" — the complete picture.

### FinOps Three-Phase Cycle

```
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│  Inform  │────►│ Optimize │────►│ Operate  │
│  Visibility│     │  Optimize │     │  Operate │
│  (Inform) │◄────│ (Optimize)│◄────│ (Operate)│
└──────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────┘
```

- **Inform (Visibility)**: Establish cost allocation tagging system (department/project/environment/application), real-time cost dashboards and budget tracking, Showback→Chargeback maturity path
- **Optimize (Optimization)**: On-demand instances → Reserved Instances/Savings Plans (save 50-70%), Spot instances for non-critical workloads, storage tiering, idle resource identification and release
- **Operate (Operations)**: Automated cost governance policies, budget alerts and anomaly detection, regular review meetings, cost optimization culture building

### Key Industry Data

| Metric | Data | Source |
|------|------|------|
| Enterprises citing cloud cost management as top challenge | **84%** | Flexera 2025/2026 |
| Enterprises with cloud costs exceeding budget | **67%** | Flexera 2025/2026 |
| Enterprises with at least 10% cloud spend waste | **82%** | Flexera 2025/2026 |
| Average savings achievable through FinOps | **20-30%** | FinOps Foundation |
| Dedicated FinOps teams (up from 51% in 2024) | **59%** | Flexera 2025 |
| FinOps actual adoption (as of 2026) | >60% of mid-to-large enterprises have established FinOps teams/functions | Flexera 2025/FinOps Foundation |
| Original Gartner forecast "70% of enterprises adopt FinOps by 2026" | Actual adoption ~60%+, met but below 2022 forecast | Flexera 2025/FinOps Foundation

### 10 FinOps Best Practices

| # | Best Practice | Description | Implementation Difficulty |
|---|---------|------|---------|
| 1 | **Business Alignment** | Cost attribution to specific business/product/project | ★★★ |
| 2 | **Cross-Functional Teams** | Finance + Technology + Business tripartite collaboration, breaking information silos | ★★★★ |
| 3 | **Real-Time Visibility** | Cost data latency ≤24 hours, ideally real-time | ★★ |
| 4 | **Showback→Chargeback** | First show departmental costs, then gradually establish cost recovery mechanisms | ★★★ |
| 5 | **Automation** | Auto-tag resources, auto-generate reports, auto-execute optimization policies | ★★★★ |
| 6 | **Budget & Alerts** | Set departmental/project budgets, auto-alert on over-budget | ★★ |
| 7 | **Reserved Instances/Savings Plans** | Purchase reserved instances for long-term stable workloads, can save 50-70% | ★★ |
| 8 | **Regular Audits** | Monthly review of cost anomalies and optimization opportunities | ★★ |
| 9 | **Cultural Education** | Engineers understand cloud costs, cultivate "every penny has an owner" culture | ★★★★★ |
| 10 | **Continuous Improvement** | Establish PDCA cycle, set year-over-year optimization KPIs | ★★★ |

### FinOps Application in Presales Scenarios

| Scenario | FinOps Perspective | Talking Point |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Cloud Solution Selection** | Compare 5-year TCO across different cloud solutions | "We select based on optimal business value, not just the coolest technology" |
| **Capacity Planning** | Provide on-demand/reserved/spot hybrid strategy | "Initial on-demand for rapid launch, reserved after stabilization saves 50%+" |
| **Architecture Design** | Serverless and containerization significantly reduce idle costs | "This architecture natively supports the FinOps three-phase cycle" |
| **Implementation Plan** | Embed FinOps training in implementation plan | "Build cloud cost awareness during construction, immediately controllable in operations" |

## International Cloud Architecture Patterns

Beyond the standard architecture patterns, the following internationally-recognized cloud architecture patterns should be in every solution architect's toolkit:

### 1. Strangler Fig Pattern
**Origin**: Martin Fowler (2004). **When to use**: Migrating legacy monolithic systems to microservices incrementally.
- Gradually replace specific functionality with new services
- Route traffic progressively from old to new
- Eventually "strangle" the monolith when all functionality is replaced
- **Risk**: Requires dual-running period; data consistency across old and new systems

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
**When to use**: Asynchronous, loosely-coupled systems; real-time data processing; IoT; microservices communication.
- Producers publish events; consumers subscribe and react
- Key patterns: Event Sourcing, Event Streaming (Kafka/Kinesis), Pub/Sub, Event Bus
- **Risk**: Eventual consistency; event schema evolution; debugging complexity

### 3. CQRS / Event Sourcing (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
**Origin**: Greg Young. **When to use**: High-read/write ratio systems; audit trail requirements; complex domain models.
- Separate read models from write models
- Commands mutate state; queries read from optimized projections
- Often paired with Event Sourcing: store state changes as an event log
- **Risk**: Increased complexity; eventual consistency; learning curve

### 4. Data Mesh
**Origin**: Zhamak Dehghani (ThoughtWorks, 2019). **When to use**: Large enterprises with multiple data domains and teams.
- Decentralized data ownership by domain
- Data as a Product — each domain publishes curated data products
- Federated governance — global standards, local implementation
- Self-serve data infrastructure platform
- **Risk**: Organizational maturity required; governance complexity; tooling ecosystem still maturing

### 5. Cell-Based Architecture
**Origin**: AWS Well-Architected Framework. **When to use**: Ultra-high availability systems; blast-radius reduction; multi-tenant SaaS.
- Each "cell" is a self-contained, independently-deployable unit
- Cells do not share databases, queues, or state
- Routing layer directs traffic to the correct cell
- **Risk**: Operational overhead; data partitioning complexity; cross-cell communication

### 6. Multi-Region Active-Active
**When to use**: Global user base; regulatory data residency; disaster recovery with RTO < 5 minutes.
- Multiple regions serve traffic simultaneously
- Data replication across regions (eventual or strong consistency)
- Global traffic management (Route 53, Cloud CDN, Azure Front Door, Cloud Load Balancing)
- **Risk**: Data conflict resolution; cost (2x+ infrastructure); operational complexity

---## Presales ROI/TCO Calculation Methodology

### TCO Full Lifecycle Cost Model

| Cost Category | Composition | Typical % of TCO | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|------|
| **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)** | Hardware, software licenses, one-time integration fees | 15-25% | One-time investment |
| **OpEx (Operational Expenditure)** | Cloud service fees, operations labor, SaaS subscriptions, bandwidth | 45-60% | Ongoing expenditure |
| **Hidden Costs** | Training, migration, downtime, security incidents, technical debt | 15-30% | Most easily overlooked |

### ROI Calculation Framework

| Metric | Formula | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| **Return on Investment (ROI)** | (Benefits - Investment) / Investment × 100% | 3-year ROI > 200% is excellent |
| **Payback Period** | Total Investment / Annualized Net Benefits | 12-18 months is reasonable |
| **Net Present Value (NPV)** | Σ(Net Cash Flow_t / (1+r)^t) | Accounts for time value of money |

### Value Proposition Quantification Template

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Value Dimension      │ Current │ Target │ Annual Value │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Efficiency Gain (Labor) │ ...    │ ...    │ $XXX K      │
│ Cost Savings (Direct)   │ ...    │ ...    │ $XXX K      │
│ Risk Reduction (Compliance)│ ... │ ...    │ $XXX K      │
│ Revenue Growth (New Biz) │ ...   │ ...    │ $XXX K      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Total Annual Value      │        │        │ $XXX K      │
│ 3-Year TCO              │        │        │ $XXX K      │
│ 3-Year ROI              │        │        │ XXX%        │
│ Payback Period          │        │        │ XX months   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Practical Advice**: In presales proposals, ROI/TCO is not "nice to have" but "must answer." Client decision-makers (especially CIO/CFO) care most about "how much, how much saved, how long to pay back." It is recommended to establish a dedicated "Investment Return Analysis" chapter in the proposal and speak with data.

## EU AI Act & DORA: 2026 Implementation Timeline for Presales

### EU AI Act — Phased Enforcement (Post-Digital Omnibus, as of June 2026)

The Digital Omnibus on AI (provisional political agreement 7 May 2026; adopted by Parliament 16 June 2026; Council adoption 29 June 2026) revised the enforcement timeline. Key phases for presales reference:

| Effective Date | What Applies | Presales Implications |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **2 Feb 2025** (in force) | Article 5 Prohibited Practices (banned AI uses) + Article 4 AI Literacy | Any AI solution proposed must not fall under prohibited categories (social scoring, real-time biometric surveillance, etc.) |
| **2 Aug 2025** (in force) | GPAI Obligations (Articles 51–56): documentation, transparency, copyright compliance | If proposing solutions built on GPAI models, verify vendor compliance |
| **2 Aug 2026** | Article 50 Transparency (chatbot/deepfake/emotional-recognition disclosure) + Article 49 EU AI Database Registration + National MSA enforcement powers | GenAI solutions must include user-facing disclosure mechanisms |
| **2 Dec 2026** (Omnibus) | Article 50(2) Watermarking (synthetic audio/image/video/text machine-readable marking) + New Article 5 CSAM/NCII prohibition | Generative AI solutions must include watermarking capabilities |
| **2 Dec 2027** (Omnibus — primary deadline) | Annex III High-Risk AI Full Enforcement: risk management, data governance, technical documentation, logging, human oversight, accuracy/cybersecurity | Proposing AI in 8 high-risk domains (employment, education, critical infrastructure, law enforcement, migration, justice, essential services, biometrics) requires full compliance pathway |
| **2 Aug 2028** (Omnibus) | Annex I Embedded High-Risk AI (safety components in regulated products) | AI embedded in medical devices, machinery, vehicles requires compliance |

**Penalties**: Up to €35M or 7% of global annual turnover for prohibited practices violations.

### DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) — Key Facts for Presales

DORA (Regulation EU 2022/2554) applies from **17 January 2025**. It mandates ICT risk management, incident reporting, digital operational resilience testing, and third-party risk management for financial entities and their ICT service providers.

| Pillar | Requirement | Presales Implications |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| **ICT Risk Management** | Comprehensive framework for ICT risk identification, protection, detection, response, recovery | Financial sector proposals must address ICT risk governance |
| **ICT Incident Reporting** | Major incidents to be reported within strict timeframes (initial: 4h, intermediate: 24h, final: 1 month) | Solutions must include incident classification and reporting mechanisms |
| **Digital Operational Resilience Testing** | Regular testing including TLPT (Threat-Led Penetration Testing) for critical entities | Proposals for financial clients must include resilience testing plans |
| **ICT Third-Party Risk** | Critical third-party ICT providers subject to oversight framework | If proposing cloud/SaaS for financial sector, must address DORA compliance |
| **Information Sharing** | Voluntary threat intelligence sharing among financial entities | Architecture should support threat intel integration |

> **Presales implication**: Solutions for EU/UK financial clients must cover DORA compliance; AI solutions must label compliance status by EU AI Act phase.
