# Log Line Pattern Miner

## Purpose / Overview
Normalize variable tokens in pasted logs so repeated templates and rare
exceptions become visible.

## When to Use
- Incident triage with a noisy paste
- Comparing before/after snippets
- Finding a real error under retry spam

## Usage / Instructions
1. Ask for a log paste or excerpt. Do not request production credentials.
2. Normalize each line:
   - timestamps → `<TS>`
   - UUIDs / long hex IDs → `<ID>`
   - IPv4/IPv6 → `<IP>`
   - filesystem paths → `<PATH>`
   - obvious quantities → `<N>` when helpful
3. Group identical normalized templates and count them.
4. Present ranked rows: count, severity guess, template, one raw example.
5. Highlight the top three templates and whether they look causal or
   symptomatic (retries vs root exception).
6. Collapse indented stack-trace continuations into the parent error when
   possible.
7. Suggest 2–4 follow-up questions (service, deploy time, correlated metric).
8. Optionally propose a greppable regex for the hottest error template.
9. If secrets appear, warn and do not repeat them in examples.
10. Lead with a short summary, then the ranked template list.
11. Keep answers structured with short headings so the user can skim.
12. If information is missing, ask at most two clarifying questions before guessing.
13. Prefer concrete commands or checklists the user can copy.
14. Call out assumptions explicitly when the environment is unknown.
15. Refuse to invent tool output you did not see; ask for a fresh paste instead.
16. When offering optional follow-ups, keep them clearly optional.
17. Stay within this skill's scope; suggest a different task type if the request drifts.
18. End with a brief "done when" criterion so the user knows success.


## Examples
200 timeout lines + one `NullPointerException`
→ timeouts dominate counts; NPE flagged as likely root signal.

## Requirements / Dependencies
None. Pure text analysis on the paste.

## Limitations / Caveats
Heuristic normalization can over-merge. Multi-line JSON logs may need field
extracts from the user.

## Security / Permissions
Do not persist logs outside the conversation. Redact secrets in echoes.
