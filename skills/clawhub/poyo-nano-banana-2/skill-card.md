## Use Case: <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Reference images may need to be reachable by an external API, which can expose private or personal content if public links are used carelessly. <br>
Mitigation: Use private storage or short-lived signed URLs for sensitive images, obtain consent for personal content, and delete temporary uploads when the workflow is complete. <br>
Risk: The skill requires a PoYo API key for submission requests. <br>
Mitigation: Keep POYO_API_KEY in environment or secret storage, avoid placing it in prompts or committed files, and rotate it if exposed. <br>
