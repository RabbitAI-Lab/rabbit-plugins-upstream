# Lantern Works — GPU prices and work-stack deals

Public, read-only data. No authentication, no environment variables.

## Hosted MCP server (Streamable HTTP)

Endpoint: `https://lantern-works-mcp.lantern-works.workers.dev/mcp`

Local alternative (stdio): `uvx lantern-works-deals-mcp` (PyPI, MIT license).

Tools (7):
| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `compare_gpu_prices` | Tracked hourly rental prices for one GPU model (e.g. H100, A100 SXM, RTX 4090, L40S), cheapest first |
| `get_price_changes` | GPU price changes among tracked providers, newest first (old/new price, change_pct, source_url) |
| `optimize_stack` | Cheapest suitable monthly stack among tracked providers for quantities you set |
| `optimize_agent_stack` | Estimate a monthly stack cost from a short free-text description of the agent |
| `search_deals` | Search agent work-stack deals (compute, search, email, unblock, hosting…) |
| `compare_deals` | Compare 2–5 deals side by side (price, unit, offer type, verification) |
| `get_deal` | One deal's public record by id |

## Public JSON API (GET, no auth)

- GPU prices: `https://thelanternworks.com/api/v1/gpu-prices.json`
  (keys include `rates`, `vendors`, `feed_updated_at`, `prices_verified_through`, `methodology`; each rate row has `gpu`, `vram_gb`, `price_usd`, `hourly_equiv_usd`, `tier`, `billing`, `interruptible`, `affiliate`, `verified_at` and a source link)
- GPU price changes: `https://thelanternworks.com/api/v1/gpu-price-changes.json` (RSS: `.xml`)
- Work-stack deals: `https://thelanternworks.com/api/v1/deals.json`

```bash
curl -s https://thelanternworks.com/api/v1/gpu-prices.json | jq '.rates[] | select(.gpu=="H100") | {advertiser, hourly_equiv_usd, tier, verified_at, affiliate}'
```

## Reading the data correctly

- "Cheapest" means cheapest **among tracked providers only**, not the whole market.
- Prices are re-read daily from each vendor's own pricing page; always report the `verified_at` / check date and link the source so the user can confirm.
- `price_usd: null` means the price is **unknown**, not free.
- Rows with `affiliate: true` use referral links; Lantern Works may earn a referral reward. Tell the user when a link you share is a referral link, and offer the vendor's direct pricing page.
- Present options neutrally and let the user's needs (price, availability, interruptibility, billing unit) decide.

## When not to use

Consumer/entertainment purchases (streaming, gaming, food delivery, etc.).
