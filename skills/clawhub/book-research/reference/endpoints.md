## Goodreads (10)

### `goodreads_author`

- **HTTP:** `GET /goodreads/author/{id}`
- **What:** Get a Goodreads author. Returns a Goodreads author profile: bio, birth/death dates, website, genres, photo, and aggregate rating stats.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Goodreads author id

### `goodreads_author_books`

- **HTTP:** `GET /goodreads/author/{id}/books`
- **What:** List a Goodreads author's books. Lists the books of a Goodreads author by author `id`, about 30 per page; `page` is 1-based and defaults to 1. Each book has its `id`, title, author, average rating, ratings count and Goodreads URL, and the `id` can be used to look up the full book.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Goodreads author id; `page` (integer, optional) — 1-based page number, default 1

### `goodreads_author_quotes`

- **HTTP:** `GET /goodreads/author/{id}/quotes`
- **What:** List a Goodreads author's attributed quotes. Returns an author's paginated attributed-quotes list (quote text, tags, like count, and — when the quote is credited to a specific book — that book's title, id, and work id).
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Goodreads author id; `page` (integer, optional) — 1-based page number, default 1

### `goodreads_book`

- **HTTP:** `GET /goodreads/book/{id}`
- **What:** Get a Goodreads book. Returns a Goodreads book: description, authors, series, genres, format, pages, publisher, publication date, ISBNs, and aggregate rating with the full 1-5 star distribution.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Goodreads book id

### `goodreads_book_editions`

- **HTTP:** `GET /goodreads/book/{id}/editions`
- **What:** List a Goodreads book's editions. Returns a work's paginated edition list (per-edition book id, format, page count, publication date, publisher, ISBN/ISBN13/ASIN, language, and rating) — every other translation, printing, and format of the requested book id. Goodreads keys editions by a separate "work id", not the book id in the path; requests against a book with no editions data return an upstream error.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Goodreads book id; `page` (integer, optional) — 1-based page number, default 1

### `goodreads_book_reviews`

- **HTTP:** `GET /goodreads/book/{id}/reviews`

- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Goodreads book id; `limit` (integer, optional) — Max reviews, default 10, max 50

### `goodreads_genre`

- **HTTP:** `GET /goodreads/genre/{name}`
- **What:** Get a Goodreads genre shelf. Returns up to 50 books on a Goodreads genre/shelf tag page (e.g. fantasy, romance, science-fiction), Goodreads' per-tag "top books" view: title, author, average rating, ratings count, publication year, and how many times the book was shelved under this specific tag. Goodreads' genre/shelf taxonomy is an open, user-generated folksonomy of thousands of tags, not a small fixed list, so there is no directory endpoint — pass any known tag slug, e.g. from a book's genres[] field or a value seen on goodreads.com. There is no pagination beyond the first 50.
- **Params:** `name` (string, **required**) — Goodreads genre/shelf tag

### `goodreads_list`

- **What:** Get a Goodreads Listopia list. Returns a Goodreads Listopia list (ranked book list) by id, paginated.
- **Params:** `id` (string, **required**) — Goodreads list id; `page` (integer, optional) — 1-based page number, default 1

### `goodreads_lists`

- **HTTP:** `GET /goodreads/lists`
- **What:** List curated Goodreads Listopia lists. Returns a catalog of well-known Goodreads Listopia lists (id, name, category). Goodreads has no directory or search endpoint for the tens of thousands of user-created lists, so this is served from a live popular-lists source when available, falling back to a curated, hand-picked catalog otherwise. Pass a returned id to GET /goodreads/list/{id} for that list's ranked book contents. Category enum: `general`, `genre`, `era`, `young_adult`, `children`, `holiday`.
- **Params:** _none_

### `goodreads_search`

- **HTTP:** `GET /goodreads/search`
- **What:** Search Goodreads books. Searches Goodreads for books by title or author using `q`, returning up to `limit` results (default 10, max 50).
