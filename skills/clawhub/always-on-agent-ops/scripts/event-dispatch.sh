# Named-event dispatcher: maps an event to the heavy cron job(s) that handle it.
# Called by preflights when (and only when) they counted work > 0.
#
# The event name is matched against a CLOSED list hardcoded in the `case` below.
# Nothing from the caller is ever concatenated into a command: an unknown event
# exits 2. The count argument is used as display text only.
#
# Guards, in order:
#   1. mkdir lock  -> two preflights firing the same event cannot double-run it.
#      Released on RETURN, EXIT, INT and TERM, plus a TTL for locks orphaned by kill -9.
#   2. job exists  -> an id that is not installed is an Error line, never a silent no-op.
#   3. runningAtMs -> the job itself is already mid-run; do not stack a second turn.
#
# EDIT THE MAPPING BELOW to the job ids ACTUALLY installed (`openclaw cron list`).
# Jobs created via `openclaw cron add` get an auto-generated UUID, not the id you
# wrote in your template. Pointing at template ids = silent no-op forever.
# Deliberately NOT `set -e`: every failure must leave a status line behind.
