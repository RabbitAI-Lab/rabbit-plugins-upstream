# OAuth expiry heuristic for an always-on agent.
# Subscription-style OAuth tokens expire in DAYS and do NOT refresh headless:
# the daemon just starts failing every turn, quietly. This detects it early.
#
# Strategy: (1) if the auth profile carries an epoch expiry field, use the
#               EARLIEST one - one file can hold several profiles, and the
#               weakest link is the one that takes the agent down;
#           (2) ONLY if the file parses and genuinely carries no expiry field,
#               fall back to the file mtime as a proxy for "last login".
#
# THE RULE: "I could not determine the expiry" is NEVER "ok". Corrupt JSON, no
# python3, or an expiry we cannot read all emit status=warn. A monitor that says
# ok when it does not know is worse than no monitor: it manufactures silence.
# Prints JSON on stdout: {"status":"ok|warn|missing", ...}. NEVER fails (exit 0)
# — a monitor that can crash is a monitor that stops monitoring.
