# OpenClaw Always-On Operations

An always-on agent does not die loudly. It goes quiet — expired auth, an unloaded plugin, a dispatcher pointing at an id that no longer exists. Everything below exists to make silence impossible.

## Access, data, and network — read before running anything

| Item | What this skill needs |
|---|---|
| Host access | A logged-in GUI desktop session, permanently. The daemon is not headless. |
| Credentials | A gateway token (loopback only), a provider auth profile, and any queue Bearer you add. All in `~/.openclaw/` or the OS keychain — never in git, never in the agent workspace. |
| Data persisted | Cron job definitions + run state (`~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json`), the agent workspace and its memory files, logs. |
| Retention — **executed, not declared** | Logs: **30 days**, deleted by `scripts/purge-retention.sh` (`cr-22`, weekly). Orphaned lock dirs: **15 min** TTL, reclaimed by the dispatcher. Cron run state: life of the job — it goes when you delete the job. Workspace/memory: **no automatic purge** — `cr-22` reports its size so growth cannot stay invisible; the number you keep is yours to set. |
| Network out | Only what YOU configure: the queue you poll, the notification channel you name. Default is no network — with no `secrets.env`, the preflight emits `Human action required` and exits 0. |
| Network in | None. The gateway binds loopback. The optional loopback listener (below) is opt-in and never leaves the host. |
| Notifications | `${NOTIFY_CHANNEL}` receives short status lines. They leave the machine. Never put secrets, PII, or payload dumps in them. |

Everything a cron reaches out to is a system you are responsible for: honour its terms of service, and for any personal data touched, apply GDPR — legal basis, minimisation, and a stated retention window — before you schedule the first run.

## Setup

```bash
# ClawHub ships text, not file modes: the exec bit does NOT survive install. Without this, a
# cron `kind: "command"` dies with exit 126 and NO status line — the silence this skill prevents.
chmod +x scripts/preflight-queue.sh scripts/event-dispatch.sh \
         scripts/oauth-expiry-check.sh scripts/purge-retention.sh   # cron-message.sh is sourced: 644
# The scripts read nothing from the network until this file exists.
cat > scripts/secrets.env <<'EOF'
QUEUE_URL=https://api.acme-corp.example/queue
API_TOKEN=replace-me
EOF
chmod 600 scripts/secrets.env      # never commit it; it is not shipped with this skill
```

| Variable | Where it lives | Who substitutes it |
|---|---|---|
| `QUEUE_URL`, `API_TOKEN` | `scripts/secrets.env` | the shell, at script run time |
| `OPENCLAW_HOME`, `OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID` | environment (optional) | the shell; default `~/.openclaw` and `main` |
| `GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `MODEL_PRIMARY`, `MODEL_FALLBACK`, `RUNTIME_ID`, `PROVIDER`, `*_PLUGIN`, `CHANNEL`, `NOTIFY_CHANNEL` | `openclaw.json` / job definitions below | **you, by hand** — OpenClaw does not interpolate `${...}` in its config. A literal `${GATEWAY_TOKEN}` left in the file is a literal token, and strict validation will not save you from it. |
| *(third-party, beyond `metadata.requires`)* | an authenticated queue endpoint you own or may call, a model provider account, a notification channel | you, before the first run |

## When to use

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| "the agent stopped doing anything" | §OAuth first (silent auth death), then `openclaw cron list` for stuck jobs |
| "gateway won't start after I edited the config" | §Config as contract — strict validation rejects unknown keys |
| "how do I make my SaaS push to the agent?" | §The loopback cascade — you cannot. Invert to outbound poll |
| "my crons burn tokens finding nothing to do" | §Preflight layer — count without an LLM |
| "the cron fires manually but never on its event" | §Gotcha: real UUID job ids vs template ids |
| "setting up a dedicated always-on machine" | §Host constraints, then §Ops checklist |

## Host constraints — the daemon is a user-level service tied to a GUI login session

| Constraint | Consequence you must implement |
|---|---|
| Service needs a logged-in session | A dedicated machine, auto-login, session never locked out. No headless server. Because the session is always unlocked, that machine must be physically secured, full-disk-encrypted, and carry no data unrelated to the agent — auto-login is only acceptable on a host with nothing else to lose. |
| Sleep kills the session | Disable disk/display sleep on AC power. |
| Restart is not automatic | A daily `gateway restart` cron (`cr-20`, 06:00) re-arms the loop. |
| A dead job stays dead | A watchdog cron 5 min later (`cr-21`, 06:05) lists jobs and reruns errored/stuck ones. |
| File-lock races | Keep `~/.openclaw` out of any syncing folder (iCloud/Dropbox). |
| Stray env overrides | A `launchctl setenv` gateway token silently overrides config → permanent "unauthorized". Unset it. |
| Node version drift | `nvm install 22 && nvm alias default 22` — check the CURRENT minimum (has been ≥22.x); a version manager keeps it identical across redeploys, the OS package does not. |
| `sharp` fails to install | It compiles against a system libvips. `SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 npm install -g openclaw@latest`, then `openclaw --version` → `2026.6.x` (verify the live release; never hardcode it in a runbook). |
| macOS ships **bash 3.2** | `mapfile`/`readarray` are bash 4+. The shipped scripts avoid them; keep anything you add 3.2-compatible. |

## The loopback cascade — `bind: "loopback"` (§Config) answers only on `127.0.0.1`

An anti-SSRF default, correct, and it decides your whole architecture:

| Consequence | What it forces |
|---|---|
| The gateway is unreachable from the public internet | No cloud service can ever push you a webhook — not your SaaS, not a git host, not a form backend. Their POST cannot arrive. |
| Every integration inverts | The agent **polls outbound**. The host is a client, never a server. |
| Freshness is not free | Push is instant; poll costs one request per interval — and an LLM turn per interval if you are careless. That price is what §Preflight exists to avoid. |
| The source of truth lives on the *other* side | The agent asks "is there work?", takes one item, acts, **acknowledges**. No ack = the item stays queued, so a killed run re-appears as work instead of vanishing. Crash-safety is free from that shape alone. |

OpenClaw does expose an inbound hook (`POST 127.0.0.1:18789/hooks/agent`, Bearer), reachable **only from the host**: useful for a local process to nudge the agent, useless from the internet. Exposing the control plane beyond loopback to "fix" this trades an SSRF-hardened default for a remote-code surface — don't. For local push, run a listener bound to `127.0.0.1` that authenticates a Bearer and accepts **one event name from a closed list hardcoded in the listener**, passing it as the dispatcher's only argument: no request body, no free-form arguments, no raw agent turn. `scripts/event-dispatch.sh` enforces that same closed list — an unrecognised event exits 2 without touching a job.

## Config as contract

`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (JSON5) is **strictly validated**: one unknown key, one wrong type, and the gateway refuses to start. OpenClaw keeps a last-known-good copy and restores it when the file is broken — so a bad edit can leave you running yesterday's config while you read today's file. Confirm with a restart, never by reading.

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    port: 18789, mode: "local", bind: "loopback",  // "local" mandatory; anything else = damaged
    auth: { mode: "token", token: "${GATEWAY_TOKEN}" },
    nodes: { denyCommands: ["camera.snap", "screen.record", "sms.send",  // capture/publish/agenda
                            "contacts.add", "calendar.add", "reminders.add"] },
  },
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "${MODEL_PRIMARY}", fallbacks: ["${MODEL_FALLBACK}"] },
      models: {                          // MANDATORY allowlist: primary+fallbacks must appear here
        "${MODEL_PRIMARY}":  { agentRuntime: { id: "${RUNTIME_ID}" } },
        "${MODEL_FALLBACK}": { agentRuntime: { id: "${RUNTIME_ID}" } } },
      workspace: "${OPENCLAW_HOME}/workspace" },
    list: [{ id: "main" }] },
  plugins: { entries: {                  // EXCLUSIVE allowlist — omitted plugin = not loaded, silently
    "${NOTIFY_PLUGIN}": { enabled: true },   // example — your chat/notification transport
    "${PROVIDER_PLUGIN}": { enabled: true }, // example — your model provider
    "${RUNTIME_PLUGIN}": { enabled: true },  // the runtime named by agentRuntime.id above; without
  } },                                       // it, agentRuntime never executes
  tools: { profile: "restricted" },      // narrowest profile that boots — jobs inherit THIS
  commands: { native: "auto", restart: true },
}
```

| Rule | Failure mode if ignored |
|---|---|
| Strict validation | Unknown key → gateway won't boot. `openclaw doctor --fix` strips unknown keys (it lists them) and writes `openclaw.json.bak`. **Read the diff** — it deletes, it does not ask. |
| `plugins` is an exclusive allowlist | A plugin you forgot simply doesn't load. No error. The feature is just absent. |
| `agents.defaults.models` is an allowlist | Model in `primary`/`fallbacks` but not listed → `Model not allowed`, thrown before any response. |
| `denyCommands` | Without it, a default set may allow capture/publish/agenda actions your always-on agent can fire unattended. |
| `commands.allowFrom` | If set, it becomes the **only** authorization source and cancels pairing/allowlists. Don't set it without a reason. |
| Restart rule | Changes to `gateway.*`, `plugins.*`, `browser.*` need `openclaw gateway restart`. Others may hot-reload. When in doubt: restart. |
| `tools.profile` is inherited | A job with no explicit `payload.tools` runs with the **global** profile. That is why the global must be the narrowest one that boots, never the widest: per-job grain is then a deliberate widening, not a hoped-for restriction. |

## Auth and runtime are two orthogonal axes

**Auth** = which account pays (a provider profile: OAuth or an API key). **Runtime** = which executor runs the agentic turn (`agentRuntime.id`). Configuring one does not configure the other. All four must be present together — miss one and it breaks *before* the first response:

| # | Ingredient | Miss it → |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `model.primary` in the live provider namespace | wrong/dead provider |
| 2 | `agentRuntime.id` set **per model** in `agents.defaults.models` | no executor |
| 3 | The runtime plugin enabled in `plugins.entries` | runtime never loads (allowlist) |
| 4 | `auth.order.<provider>` lists the profile | a profile outside `order` is **never tried** |

```bash
openclaw models list --provider ${PROVIDER}   # never copy model names from a runbook — enumerate
# Output: no results  <- legacy <provider>-<runtime>/* namespace is dead; `doctor --fix` rewrites it
```

**For an unattended host, use an API key.** It is the supported path: pay-per-token, no expiry, no human in the loop. OAuth is subscription-priced but expires in days and needs a browser — on a 24/7 host you trade money against a recurring silent outage, and the outage wins. `auth-profiles.json` (in `~/.openclaw/agents/<agent>/agent/`) is a **credential, not a config file** — treat it like a private key: never in git, no SecretRef support. Copying it to another host is *gray-area and not the recommended path*: only acceptable if your provider's terms allow that account on that machine. Check the terms before you copy.

## Failure #1: OAuth dies silently

A subscription OAuth token expires in **days** and does **not** refresh headless. The daemon keeps running; every turn just fails. Nobody is watching at 03:00. This is the single most common way an always-on agent dies.

```bash
OPENCLAW_HOME=~/.openclaw ./scripts/oauth-expiry-check.sh
# EARLIEST epoch expiry wins: a fresh profile must never mask a dead one, nor a 90-day refresh token
# a dead access token. It names the deciding `field` and NEVER exits non-zero. "Cannot determine" is
# NEVER `ok`: corrupt JSON, no python3, an unreadable (ISO-8601) expiry all emit `warn` — the mtime
# proxy is reached ONLY when the file parses and genuinely carries no expiry field at all.
# Output: {"status":"warn","source":"expires_at","field":"profiles.dead.expires_at","remaining_days":-1,"note":"...relogin..."}
# Output: {"status":"warn","source":"unresolved","reason":"corrupt_json","note":"Cannot verify token expiry..."}
```

Wire it to `cr-23` (below), whose only instruction is: run the script, and if `status` is `warn` or `missing`, alert `${NOTIFY_CHANNEL}` that a **human relogin** is needed. The cron must **not** attempt the login itself — that flow needs a real browser. Alert on warn; stay silent on ok.

## Cron layer

The scheduler is in-process in the gateway; jobs persist to `~/.openclaw/cron/jobs.json`. No system crontab.

```json5
{ id: "cr-10-worker", agentId: "main", enabled: true,
  schedule: { kind: "cron", expr: "0 9-18 * * 1-5", tz: "UTC" },  // IANA tz; or kind:"every"/"at"
  sessionTarget: "isolated", wakeMode: "now",   // isolated = inherits no context, no credentials-in-
  payload: { kind: "agentTurn", message: "…",   // conversation, no half-done state from another run
             model: "${MODEL_PRIMARY}", fallbacks: ["${MODEL_FALLBACK}"],
             tools: ["exec", "read"],           // ALWAYS explicit: a read-only audit and a job that
             thinking: "medium",                // pushes branches must not share an authority
             timeoutSeconds: 2400 },            // surface just because they share a host
  delivery: { mode: "announce", channel: "${CHANNEL}", to: "${NOTIFY_CHANNEL}" },
  failureAlert: { after: 2, to: "${NOTIFY_CHANNEL}", cooldownMs: 1800000 } }
```

The four housekeeping jobs the §Ops checklist watches — `argv[0]` is an **absolute path** in every case, a cron's `PATH` is not your shell's — then the four laws for anything that runs unattended:

| id | Schedule | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `cr-20-restart` | `{ kind: "cron", expr: "0 6 * * *", tz: "UTC" }` | `{ kind: "command", argv: ["/opt/homebrew/bin/openclaw", "gateway", "restart"] }` |
| `cr-21-watchdog` | `{ kind: "cron", expr: "5 6 * * *", tz: "UTC" }` | `{ kind: "agentTurn", tools: ["exec"], message: "Run openclaw cron list. Rerun errored/stuck jobs. Report one status line." }` |
| `cr-22-purge` | `{ kind: "cron", expr: "0 5 * * 0", tz: "UTC" }` | `{ kind: "command", argv: ["/abs/path/to/scripts/purge-retention.sh"] }` |
| `cr-23-oauth` | `{ kind: "cron", expr: "0 8 * * *", tz: "UTC" }` | `{ kind: "agentTurn", tools: ["exec"], message: "Run scripts/oauth-expiry-check.sh. If status is warn or missing, alert that a human relogin is needed. Silent on ok." }` |

- **Idempotence first.** A cron wakes with no memory. Before acting, read the state: your own index file *and* the remote's. In doubt, SKIP — a skipped run costs nothing, a duplicate action costs trust.
- **Failure = no ack.** If a check goes red, don't acknowledge. The item stays queued and a healthy later run takes it. Never ack to make an alert stop.
- **Bounded backoff, not correction.** The scheduler retries a failed run with bounded backoff (roughly ~30s → 1m → 5m → 15m, ~3 attempts, reset on success). Never *depend* on retry to fix a logic failure — that's what the un-acked queue is for.
- **One normalized status line.** Every job and script emits the same shape via `scripts/cron-message.sh`. Without it, ten jobs invent ten formats and the channel becomes unreadable within a week.

## Output format — every job, every script

```text
<job-id> - <Done | Nothing to do | Started | Blocked | Human action required | Error>
Result: <one factual sentence>
Item: <what was touched>
Next action: <what happens next, or "none">
Details: <short key=value context, never a secret>

dispatch - Started               <- emitted by the DISPATCHER when a preflight counts > 0;
Result: Job requested.              the preflight stays silent and execs it. Verified output.
Item: cr-10-worker
Next action: OpenClaw runs it now.
Details: event=work_ready count=2
```

## Preflight layer

Stop paying an LLM turn to discover there is nothing to do. Split every heavy job in two: the preflight counts and, if `count > 0`, calls the dispatcher with a **named event**; the dispatcher runs the matching job(s) now. The heavy job keeps a widely-spaced `every` schedule as a safety net for the day a preflight silently breaks. Result: near-event-driven latency at poll-loop cost, with a floor under it.

| Layer | Kind | Frequency | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pf-*` preflight | `kind: "command"` (argv → shell script) | every 5–15 min | one curl + a count. **Zero LLM.** |
| `cr-*` heavy job | `kind: "agentTurn"` | `every` 6h **fallback only** | a full agent turn |

```json5
{ id: "pf-10-queue", enabled: true, schedule: { kind: "every", ms: 600000 },   // 10 min
  payload: { kind: "command", argv: ["/abs/path/to/scripts/preflight-queue.sh"] } }  // cron PATH != yours
```

> **THE PREFLIGHT DECIDES NOTHING. IT COUNTS.** It must never claim an item, mutate state, or reason about what to do — the moment a preflight starts judging, you have a second, cheaper, untested agent making production decisions in bash. Count, dispatch, exit.

**`every` does not spread a fleet — it phase-locks it.** The table above tells you to give each heavy job a widely-spaced `every` as its safety net. Do that for five jobs in one provisioning pass and all five fire **together, forever**. Interval schedules do not drift: equal intervals preserve whatever phase the jobs were created with, and a fleet provisioned in one pass was created seconds apart. Pick a round anchor and it is worse — five jobs at `everyMs: 21600000` created on a timestamp that divides evenly by 6h land on the same 00/06/12/18 grid to the second. Five agent turns spawning worktrees, installs and a browser at the same instant on one host is a safety net that has become the outage.

Two things sharpen it. **The fallback bypasses your only concurrency guard**: the scheduler fires the job directly, so it never passes through `event-dispatch.sh` and neither the `mkdir` lock nor the `runningAtMs` check is in the loop — the one moment the fleet is most likely to collide is the one moment nothing is guarding it. And **the daily restart re-anchors**: `cr-20` reloads every job at once, so a fleet you hand-staggered can silently re-converge after a reboot.

| Do | Not |
|---|---|
| Give each heavy fallback an explicit `cron` expression on its own minute — the way `cr-20`…`cr-23` above already are (`0 6`, `5 6`, `0 5`, `0 8`). `openclaw cron list` then **shows** you the phase plan. | Five `every: 6h` jobs and the assumption they will drift apart. They will not. |
| `staggerMs` if your release carries it — confirm with `openclaw cron get <id>` on the version you actually run, never from a runbook. | A phase plan that exists only as arithmetic nobody re-derives at 03:00. |

Verify rather than trust the shape: `openclaw cron list`, read the next-run times, and check that no two heavy jobs share a minute. If they do, you have not built a safety net — you have built a thundering herd with a 6-hour period.

```bash
./scripts/preflight-queue.sh
# Tolerant count: numeric `count`, else the SHALLOWEST array anywhere (nested {data:{items:[…]}} still
# counts; an API renaming `items` to `results` degrades to a count, not a crash loop). "Counted zero"
# is NOT "found nothing to count": an empty array is 0, but no-count-and-no-array — a 200 carrying
# {"error":"unauthorized"}, 502 HTML, a captive portal — is an Error. A green "Nothing to do" while the
# queue fills is worse than a crash. No secrets.env, dead host, junk body -> one status line, exit 0,
# never a bare shell error. Hence no `set -e`: a broken preflight must still produce a line.
# Output: pf-10-queue - Nothing to do / Result: Queue empty. / ... / Details: count=0
# Output: pf-10-queue - Error / Result: Payload carries no count and no array... / Details: reason=no_countable_field
```

`scripts/event-dispatch.sh` maps events → jobs, with three guards:

1. **`mkdir` lock** per job id — atomic, no race, released on `RETURN`, `EXIT`, `INT` and `TERM`, plus a TTL. `trap ... RETURN` alone is not enough: a `kill -9`, the 06:00 restart or a sleeping machine leaves the dir behind and blocks that event **forever**, while the channel keeps printing a healthy-looking `Blocked`. A lock older than `LOCK_TTL_MIN` (default 15) is reclaimed.
2. **Job exists** — `openclaw cron get <id>` first. A non-zero exit, an empty answer, or a reply that is not JSON carrying that id is an `Error` line naming the fix. It classifies into exactly `unknown | running | idle`, so a release whose `cron get` exits 0 and prints prose ("job not found") cannot fall through to a run on a bogus id. Verify yours: `openclaw cron get nope; echo $?`.
3. **`runningAtMs` guard** — if the job is mid-run, report `Blocked` and return 0. Never stack turns on a running job.

One event may fan out to several jobs (`source_changed` → reviewer + drift-watch). The shipped mapping's `cr-30-reviewer` and `cr-40-drift-watch` are **illustrative placeholders — this skill defines only `cr-10-worker` and `cr-20`…`cr-23`**; until you point them at jobs you installed, those two events dispatch to nothing but an `Error` line (which is the designed failure, not a silent one). Keep the event vocabulary about **what happened in the world** (`work_ready`, `review_needed`, `source_changed`), never about which job you want to run — that's the mapping's job, and it's the only place that changes when you rename a cron.

## Gotchas

| Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Event dispatch reports success, job never runs | **`openclaw cron add` accepts no `--id`: the installed job gets an auto-generated UUID**, and its name is prefixed. Your template's tidy `cr-30-reviewer` exists only in your file. The dispatcher's `openclaw cron run cr-30-reviewer` targets a job that was never installed — and it fails in a way that reads like nothing happened. Every job created via CLI is affected; only hand-seeded `jobs.json` entries keep their ids. | `openclaw cron list`, copy the **real** ids, and point the mapping at those. Re-check after any re-provisioning: new install, new UUIDs. |
| Script dies with no status line, exit 126 | The exec bit did not survive install — ClawHub ships text, not modes | `chmod +x scripts/*.sh` (§Setup). `cron-message.sh` stays 644 |
| Feature configured but absent, no error | `plugins` allowlist is exclusive — the entry is missing | Add it to `plugins.entries` and **restart** |
| `Model not allowed` before any answer | Model used but not in `agents.defaults.models` | Add it with its `agentRuntime` |
| Gateway won't boot after an edit | Strict validation rejected an unknown key | `openclaw doctor --fix`, read the stripped-key list and the `.bak` |
| Config edited, behaviour unchanged | Last-known-good restored, or `gateway.*`/`plugins.*` needs a restart | `openclaw gateway restart`, then verify live state |
| Persistent "unauthorized" on loopback | A `launchctl setenv` token overrides the config file | Unset it, restart |
| Dispatch always says `Blocked`, no job ever runs | A killed run (restart, sleep, `kill -9`) orphaned its lock dir; the channel looks healthy | `rm -rf "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}"/openclaw-event-*.lock`. The TTL reclaims it after `LOCK_TTL_MIN`; lower it if your jobs are short |
| `cr-23` says `ok` while every turn fails | Several profiles in one auth file, and a fresh one masked the dead one — the shipped checker takes the **earliest** expiry precisely for this | Read `field` in the JSON: it names the profile that decided. If you wrote your own checker, take the min — and make "cannot determine" a `warn`, never an `ok` |
| `cr-22` reports `Not an OpenClaw home` | `OPENCLAW_HOME` points somewhere without `openclaw.json` or `agents/` — a typo or a stale env var | Intended: the purge refuses any dir it cannot prove is an agent home rather than deleting on faith. Fix the variable |
| All runs fail overnight, no alert | OAuth expired headless | `cr-23` + human relogin; consider an API key |
| Notification channel unreadable | Jobs invented their own formats | One `cron-message.sh`, no exceptions |

## Ops checklist

| Watch | Cadence | Symptom → cause |
|---|---|---|
| `openclaw gateway status` | daily (`cr-20` restart 06:00) | not up → session logged out / machine slept |
| `openclaw cron list` | daily (`cr-21` watchdog 06:05) | errored/stuck jobs → rerun; missing next-run → scheduler restart |
| `oauth-expiry-check.sh` | daily (`cr-23` 08:00) | `warn`/`missing` → human relogin, today |
| Preflight + `dispatch` status lines | continuous | `reason=no_countable_field` → the endpoint changed shape or the token died (it self-reports; it does not print a green `Nothing to do`); `dispatch - Error` → mapping points at dead ids |
| Heavy-job fallback runs | weekly | fallback firing every time → the preflight is broken, fix the preflight |
| Logs + workspace size | weekly (`cr-22` purge 05:00 Sun) | logs past 30d → purged automatically; workspace growing → set your own bound |
| `openclaw --version` + Node | on update | after `openclaw update`: `doctor`, `gateway restart`, `health` |

## Scope

This skill ONLY: configures an OpenClaw host you control; polls endpoints **you** own or are authorized to call; schedules jobs with per-job tool restrictions; monitors auth expiry and alerts a human; deletes only its own logs past the stated window; emits normalized status lines.

This skill NEVER: exposes the control plane beyond loopback; bypasses an anti-abuse control, rate limit, or authentication check — when a defence triggers, the run **stops and pings a human** instead of adapting; performs an irreversible action unattended; conceals a failure behind an ack; writes secrets into the workspace, the notification channel, or git.
