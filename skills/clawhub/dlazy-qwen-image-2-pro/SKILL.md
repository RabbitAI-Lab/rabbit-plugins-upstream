# 文生图 通义 Qwen Image 2 Pro

[English](./SKILL.md) · [中文](./SKILL-cn.md)


Alibaba Bailian qwen-image-2.0-pro general image generation. Excels at complex text rendering, multi-line layout, photorealistic detail, and strong semantic adherence — great for mixed text/image designs.

## Trigger Keywords

- qwen-image-2-pro

## Authentication

All requests require a dLazy API key. The recommended way to authenticate is:

```bash
dlazy login
```

This runs a device-code flow (also works in remote shells) and **automatically saves your API key** to the local CLI config — no manual copy/paste required.

### Alternative: Set the Key Manually

If you already have an API key, you can save it directly:

```bash
dlazy auth set YOUR_API_KEY
```

The CLI saves the key in your user config directory (`~/.dlazy/config.json` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.dlazy\config.json` on Windows), with file permissions restricted to your OS user account. You can also supply the key per-invocation via the `DLAZY_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Getting Your API Key Manually

1. Sign in or create an account at [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com)
2. Go to [dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key](https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key)
3. Copy the key shown in the API Key section

Each key is scoped to your dLazy organization and can be **rotated or revoked at any time** from the same dashboard.

## About & Provenance

- **CLI source code**: [github.com/dlazyai/cli](https://github.com/dlazyai/cli)
- **Maintainer**: dlazyai
- **npm package**: `@dlazy/cli` (pinned to `1.2.3` in this skill's install spec)
- **Homepage**: [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com)

You can install on demand without persisting a global binary by running:

```bash
npx @dlazy/cli@1.2.3 <command>
```

Or, if you prefer a global install, the skill's `metadata.clawdbot.install` field declares the exact pinned version (`npm install -g @dlazy/cli@1.2.3`). Review the GitHub source before installing.

## How It Works

This skill is a thin client over the dLazy hosted API. When you invoke it:

- Prompts and parameters you provide are sent to the dLazy API endpoint (`api.dlazy.com`) for inference.
- Any local file paths you pass to image / video / audio fields are uploaded to dLazy's media storage (`files.dlazy.com`) so the model can read them — the same flow as any cloud-based generation API.
- Generated output URLs returned by the API are hosted on `files.dlazy.com`.

This is the standard SaaS pattern; the skill itself does not access network or filesystem resources beyond what the dLazy CLI already handles. See [dlazy.com](https://dlazy.com) for the full service terms.

## Usage

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR AGENT**:
Execute `dlazy qwen-image-2-pro` to get the result.

```bash
dlazy qwen-image-2-pro -h

Options:
  --prompt [prompt]                    Prompt
  --images [images...]                 Images [image: url or local path] (max 3)
  --negative_prompt [negative_prompt]  Negative Prompt (describe what you don't want in the image) [default: ]
  --size [size]                        Size [default: 2048*2048] (choices: "2688*1536", "1536*2688", "2048*2048", "2368*1728", "1728*2368")
  --prompt_extend [prompt_extend]      Prompt Rewrite [default: true]
  --dry-run                            Print payload + cost estimate without calling API
  --no-wait                            Return generateId immediately for async tasks
  --timeout <seconds>                  Max seconds to wait for async completion (default: "1800")
  --save <path>                        Download the result asset to this local path (mkdir + retry handled for you)
  -h, --help                           display help for command
```

> Any flag also accepts pipe references — `-` (auto-pick from upstream stdin), `@N` (n-th output), `@N.path` (jsonpath into output), `@*` (all primary values), `@stdin` / `@stdin:path` (whole envelope). See `dlazy --help` for details.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": {
    "tool": "qwen-image-2-pro",
    "modelId": "qwen-image-2-pro",
    "outputs": [
      {
        "type": "image",
        "id": "o_xxxxxxxx",
        "url": "https://files.dlazy.com/result.png",
        "mimeType": "image/png"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> Async tasks (when `--no-wait` is passed) return `outputs: []` and a `task: { generateId, status }` field instead. Use `dlazy status <generateId> --wait` to poll.

## Examples

```bash
dlazy qwen-image-2-pro --prompt 'prompt content'
```

## Error Handling

| Code | Error Type                         | Example Message                                                                                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 401  | Unauthorized (No API Key)          | `ok: false, code: "unauthorized", message: "API key is missing or invalid"`                                                              |
| 501  | Missing required parameter         | `error: required option '--prompt <prompt>' not specified`                                                              |
| 502  | Local file read error              | `Error: Image file/Video file not found: C:\path\to\your\file`                                                          |
| 503  | API request failed (no balance)    | `ok: false, code: "insufficient_balance"` |
| 503  | API request failed (server error)  | `HTTP status code error (500 server crash)`                                                                             |
| 504  | Asynchronous task execution failed | `=== Generation Failed ===` / `{Specific error reason returned by backend, for example "Prompt violates safety policy"}` |

> **AGENT CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: 
> 1. If the execution result returns `code: "insufficient_balance"`, you MUST explicitly inform the user that their credits are insufficient and guide them to recharge: [https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/settings?tab=credits](https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/settings?tab=credits)
> 2. If the execution result returns `code: "unauthorized"` or indicates missing API key, you MUST inform the user to get their API key from [https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key](https://dlazy.com/dashboard/organization/api-key) and save it using `dlazy auth set <key>` and resume the task.
