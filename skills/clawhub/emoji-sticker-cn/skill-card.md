### License/Terms of Use:

MIT

## Use Case:

External creators, designers, and developers use this skill to prepare sticker packs and sticker-related copy for Chinese social platforms, especially WeChat sticker submissions and Xiaohongshu or Douyin inline images. It also supports local resizing, animated GIF creation, metadata preparation, and rule-inspection workflows.

### Deployment Geography for Use:

Global

## Known Risks and Mitigations:

Risk: Rule-inspection requests may fetch current platform pages and propose edits to the skill's reference files.

Mitigation: Review fetched-source summaries and file diffs before approving any reference updates.

Risk: Sticker generation or sensitive-word checks may send prompts, images, or text to host-provided external tools when the user chooses those workflows.

Mitigation: Confirm paid ImageGen usage and external sensitive-word checking before sending user content to those tools.

Risk: Offline prohibited-word references are a fallback and may not reflect fast-changing platform enforcement.

Mitigation: Prefer the host's real-time multi-wordcheck workflow when available and treat offline checks as limited pre-screening.
